== Career ==
Scarlet Envy first started drag in college, choosing her name from the lead character of the film Gone with the Wind, Scarlett O'Hara. She entered a drag pageant, where she learned that she didn't have the typical drag skills of dancing and pageantry. This experience, and having drag queen friends, ignited her drag career. She has credited her successful career to persistence, energy, and acceptance. Scarlet Envy is the "drag daughter" of Drag Race season 7 finalist Pearl.
After auditioning four times, Scarlet Envy was cast on the eleventh season of Drag Race in 2018. She won the second episode's challenge along with Yvie Oddly. She participated in a six-way lip sync on the third episode, won the mini-challenge in the fourth episode, and was eliminated on the sixth episode, after placing in the bottom two and losing a lip-sync to Ra'Jah O'Hara. Scarlet Envy returned for the sixth season of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, which aired in 2021. She placed safe in the first four episodes and was eliminated in the fifth by Ginger Minj, placing ninth overall.
Scarlet Envy played the title role of Yma Sumac in a production of The Legend of Yma Sumac at The Laurie Beechman Theatre, New York City. She was also featured on a season finale of Saturday Night Live as a dancer during Katy Perry's performance of "Swish Swish", alongside fellow Drag Race contestants Brita Filter, Vivacious, and Yuhua Hamasaki.
