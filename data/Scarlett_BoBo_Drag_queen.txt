== Career ==

Originally from Ottawa, Ontario, Scarlett BoBo began performing as a drag queen in the spring of 2008. Her drag mother is Tenora BoBo, with their surname coming from house mother Ginette BoBo. She moved to Toronto in 2009. She studied public relations at Humber College, and has also taken classes at circus school, incorporating skills like fire eating and aerial silks into her drag performances. Treating her drag as a form of activism, she has performed at a benefit for the Orlando nightclub shooting, as a host of the city's annual AIDS Walk for HIV/AIDS, and as the creator of the all-gender-inclusive Absolut Empire's Ball. She has also been an active supporter of Rainbow Railroad, regularly directing a share of the proceeds from her endeavours to the organization.
In May 2020, Scarlett Bobo was announced as a contestant in the first season of the reality competition series Canada's Drag Race. She was consistently safe or high throughout the season, and won the key ball challenge, ultimately placing as a runner-up in the finale alongside Rita Baga and behind winner Priyanka. She was only the second queen in the entire history of the Drag Race franchise, following Bianca Del Rio, to make it to the finale without ever having placed low in any challenge during the season. Following the conclusion of the season, she headlined a cross-Canada tour with the other Canada's Drag Race contestants, which was performed at drive-in venues due to the ongoing social distancing restrictions remaining in place during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. In October, she participated alongside Priyanka, Rita Baga and Jimbo in an online panel discussion as part of the Just for Laughs festival.
For Fierté Montréal's special online edition of its annual Drag Superstars show, which featured all of the Canada's Drag Race queens in prerecorded video performances, Scarlett Bobo performed to Pink's single "Just Like Fire".
Underneath the Empire, a documentary film about Scarlett BoBo and the Absolut Empire's Ball, was screened at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in 2019 before having its television premiere on OutTV in April 2021.
