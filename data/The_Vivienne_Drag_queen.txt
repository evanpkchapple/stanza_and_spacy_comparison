Williams married David Ludford in 2019. In April 2023, the couple announced their separation.
In June 2023, The Vivienne fell victim to a homophobic attack in a McDonald's restaurant in Liverpool. In a statement, Merseyside Police confirmed that "a man made homophobic comments towards him [The Vivienne] and then proceeded to punch him in the face before fleeing the scene". The Vivienne utilised the attack as a way of highlighting the fact that homophobia still exists in 2023 and for members of the LGBT+ community to remain vigilant when out in public. In December 2023, Alan Whitfield, 51, of Tom Mann Close, Everton, was found guilty of assault motivated by homophobia. He was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison with an 18 month suspended sentence on 5 January 2024.
