Cameron Clayton, better known by the stage name Farrah Moan (born September 11, 1993), is an American drag queen, model, actor, make-up artist and internet personality best known for participating in the 9th season of the reality TV show RuPaul's Drag Race, placing eighth, as well as participating in the 4th season of All Stars, where she placed ninth.
