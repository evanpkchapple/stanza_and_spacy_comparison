== Early life ==
Johnson was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He is the third contestant from the city to compete on RuPaul's Drag Race and the second winner after Trixie Mattel (winner of All Stars Season 3). He cites Milwaukee's sense of community and diversity of drag as major influences, especially its country tongue. He performed for a period of time at Hamburger Mary's.


== Career ==
Johnson began drag in the early 2010s. Her name is a product of personal anecdotes and experiences that hold meaning. A friend called her "Jaida" when she put on a wig for the first time, and the name stuck. "Essence" came from her boyfriend, who called her "the essence of beauty" in a text message. "Hall" is the name of her drag family; her mothers are Tajma Hall and Prada Diamond, and her drag sisters are Mercedes Iman Diamond, Naysha Lopez, Dida Ritz, and Kahmora Hall.
She rose to prominence in the drag scene through pageantry, winning titles such as Miss Five, Miss Gay Madison, Miss Wisconsin Club, and Miss City of the Lakes. She also performed a halftime show at a 2019 Milwaukee Bucks game. Jaida is known for her design eye and makes many of her own outfits; her boyfriend makes her jewelry. She is also a makeup artist and painted Silky Nutmeg Ganache's face for the season eleven finale of RuPaul's Drag Race.

Jaida was announced as a contestant on the twelfth season of RuPaul's Drag Race on January 23, 2020.
