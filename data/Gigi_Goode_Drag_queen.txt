Goode was born on December 2, 1997, in Woodstock, Illinois, and has Scottish and Scandinavian ancestry. Her mother, Kristi, is a costume and interior designer. Goode was introduced to LGBT culture at the age of 12 by her openly gay uncle. She started doing drag at an early age with the help of her mother, who initially disapproved of it, and she performed in drag in public for the first time at age 15.

Monroe Art Award in 2017, which honors "outstanding achievement in art, recognizing students for their major, excellence in their work and exhibiting a professional attitude".
