== Early life ==
Martell Robinson was born on October 16, 1976, in Los Angeles County, California. He first did drag in 1997 at the age of 21 by impersonating Patti LaBelle. The drag name "Jasmine Masters" came from Jasmine Guy and her drag mother, Destiny Masters. He auditioned for Drag Race beginning with Season two.


== Career ==
Before Drag Race, Robinson appeared as the character, Mordecai, in the 2008 film First Sunday. He also appeared with fellow Drag Race alumnus Willam for an episode of The New Normal in 2013.


=== RuPaul's Drag Race ===
Jasmine was announced as one of the fourteen contestants for season seven of RuPaul's Drag Race on March 2, 2015. She was eliminated in the third episode after lip-syncing against Kennedy Davenport, and placed 12th overall. During her time on the show, she received online death threats including racist remarks, which eventually led to RuPaul defending Masters on Twitter. Masters would be referenced in 2017 by Nina Bo'Nina Brown for season nine of Drag Race, with Brown impersonating her for the annual "Snatch Game".
Masters competed on the Drag Race television special RuPaul's Drag Race Holi-slay Spectacular. Masters later posted a YouTube video explaining why she wasn't featured as much as the other contestants in the special, stating that Shangela was late during one of the rehearsals, which caused Masters to become frustrated and leave the set early.
Masters was announced to compete on the fourth season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. She was eliminated in the first episode by Trinity the Tuck after her stand-up performance for the annual talent show, placing 10th. She had a chance to return in sixth episode, where the eliminated queens faced off with the queens still in running, but lost a lip sync to Trinity, conclusively eliminating her from the competition.
She appeared as a guest for the first challenge in the premiere of season eleven of Drag Race.


=== After Drag Race ===
After Drag Race, she was one of thirty drag queens featured in Miley Cyrus's 2015 VMA performance.
Masters gained notoriety with her self-published YouTube videos on her channel. Her video "RuPaul Dragrace fucked up drag", criticizing the show's portrayal of drag, sparked criticism from fans and queens including Phi Phi O'Hara. The video was featured in Willam's internet show, "Willam's Beatdown". Her video "Fix ur breath" was featured in a post on Justin Bieber's Instagram page, making Masters go viral.
Because of Masters's viral success, she is the host of her own web show with WowPresents called "Jasmine Masters' Class" that premiered its first episode in 2018.
