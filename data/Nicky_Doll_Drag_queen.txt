== Early life ==
Sanchez was born on March 14, 1991, in Marseille, France, but also travelled quite a bit as a child, living in St. Martin and Morocco. His mother is Spanish.


== Career ==
Sanchez trained to be a make-up artist. He created his drag persona in 2009 and has modeled extensively as Nicky Doll, appearing on the pages of Féroce Magazine, Cosmopolitan and Volition Magazine among others. Sanchez developed his drag persona by himself. He does not have a drag mother, nor does he belong to any drag family. The name Nicky Doll is a tribute to Nicki Minaj and is meant to evoke versatility and reflect the different personalities Sanchez's drag persona exhibits. Sanchez self-describes Nicky Doll as a 90's life-size doll.
Nicky Doll's participation on season 12 of RuPaul’s Drag Race was announced on January 23, 2020. She is the first French contestant on the US version of the show. She was described as a ‘look queen’ and has spoken openly about “deep insecurities when it comes to the language barrier” that she experienced during the show. She made attempts to change that impression by applying silly makeup and hamming it up as the baby in the Gay’s Anatomy acting challenge.
Ultimately, it wasn't enough and Nicky Doll was eliminated at the end of episode 5, and placed eleventh overall. During her time on the show, Nicky Doll was in the top once, and in the bottom two times. She successfully lip-synced "for his life" against Dahlia Sin in episode 3, to Problem by Ariana Grande featuring Iggy Azalea. In episode 5, she was unsuccessful in his performance against Heidi N Closet to the song "Heart to Break" by Kim Petras. As a result of his appearance on Drag Race, Nicky Doll was hand-picked by RuPaul to do Pete Davidson's makeup for a pre-recorded sketch on an episode of Saturday Night Live which was hosted by RuPaul.
In March 2022, Nicky Doll was announced as the host of Drag Race France. The first season of Drag Race France premiered on June 25, 2022. Nicky Doll will provide commentary for the French broadcast of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 semi-finals on Culturebox.


== Personal life ==
Sanchez came out as gay at the age of 18. He relocated from Paris to San Francisco in 2015, before moving to New York in 2017.
