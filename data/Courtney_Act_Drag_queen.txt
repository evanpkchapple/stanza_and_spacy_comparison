== Early life ==
Shane Gilberto Jenek was born in Brisbane, Australia, and moved to Sydney at age 18. He was born to Gill and Annette Jenek and has an older sister named Kim. His mother is of Danish descent and his father is of German descent; they worked in Kings Cross and befriended cabaret performer and TV personality Carlotta. Growing up, Jenek would always dress up and sing and dance, but couldn't identify with anything that was portrayed in the media. In 1987, he entered a competition, Tiny Tots, which was a charity pageant show for children, and won. At a young age, Jenek began attending The Fame Talent School where he became close friends with twins Lisa Origliasso and Jessica Origliasso, who would later become The Veronicas. The group would perform together for twelve years, performing acts such as pantomime in local shopping centres such as the Strathpine Centre, the Toombul Shopping Centre, and Westfield Chermside. Jenek found school difficult due to bullying over his sexuality. He began to think something was wrong with him during his teenage years. He attended Nashville Primary School in Brighton, but his parents wanted him to go to a private school for his secondary studies, so he transferred to St Paul's Anglican School in Bald Hills a year early to "acclimatise". Jenek disliked the school, and moved to Sandgate District State High School after two years at St. Paul's. After school, he would frequently go clubbing with friends in Brisbane, particularly on Mary Street. Jenek received high grades at school and he was going to study medicine to become a doctor instead of an entertainer. He first attended the Stonewall Club in the mid-90s and Jenek states that was the start of his "big queer life". While touring colleges, he visited the National Institute of Dramatic Art, and, instead of moving forward to Perth to tour the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, he spent a week in Sydney behind his parents’ backs "living a lifetime of gay".


== Career ==


=== Beginnings and Australian Idol ===
Jenek's drag queen career began in 2002 when he met Sydney drag queen Vanity Faire. He was intrigued by the visual feminine illusion Faire would create once she was in drag and this inspired him to begin his drag career. While deciding his drag name, he originally intended to take the name "Ginger Le'Bon" and be a "redheaded, smoky voiced nightclub singer", but, instead, he decided upon the stage name Courtney Act as, in a non-rhotic accent like the Australian accent, the phrase "caught in the act" is heard. Courtney has stated that in 2002, when she began performing in drag, one had to "fight" and "earn" one's place as a drag queen. She entered the Diva Rising Star competition in 2002 and won.
In 2003, while working as a waiter at Jimmy's on the Mall, a restaurant in Brisbane, Courtney auditioned for the inaugural season of Australian Idol. He first appeared as Jenek, but the judges, Ian Dickson, Marcia Hines and Mark Holden, told Jenek that his voice was "just not up to it". The following day, Jenek returned to audition but as Courtney Act. Hines said that Courtney was "great". Dickson said, "Shane only didn't just cut it. You've added another dimension and this time you've blown us away." Courtney continued through the competition and reached the live finals. In the first TV vote Courtney did not advance; however, the judges brought her back as a wildcard. During her time on the show she performed songs such as: "I Am Woman" by Helen Reddy, "You Don't Own Me" by Lesley Gore and “You Shook Me All Night Long" by AC/DC. Courtney finished in thirteenth place on the show, but remained highly popular throughout Australia. At the time, Jenek was the first and only LGBT contestant to openly appear on a reality TV talent show.
Together with business partner  and fellow drag queen Vanity Faire, Courtney operates Wigs by Vanity; they started the company in 2003, the year Courtney auditioned for idol, with the aim of producing wigs for drag queens.
