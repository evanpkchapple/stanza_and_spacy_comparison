Nick Hall (formerly Kennedy-Hall, born 10 July 1989), better known by the stage name Anita Wigl'it, is a British-New Zealand based drag performer best known for hosting House of Drag from 2018 to 2020, and competing on the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under in 2021. She competed in Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World in 2022.


== Early life ==
Kennedy-Hall was born in Yeovil, England and moved to Auckland at age 10. He completed a Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Music (Honours) in music performance (with first class honours) at University of Auckland and a Masters of Music degree at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, before returning to New Zealand and joining the Royal New Zealand Navy Band as a trumpet player. His husband Shameel Kennedy, under the name Ivanna Drink, competed on the third season of Drag Race Down Under. In August 2023, the couple announced that they had separated.


== Career ==
In 2018, Anita and Kita Mean were both judges on the New Zealand drag show House of Drag from 2018 to 2020, where they became known as the duo "Kita and Anita". The duo are also partners in Caluzzi, a drag cabaret in downtown Auckland.
In March 2021, both Anita and Kita were announced as contestants to compete on the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under. During the show, Anita won the Snatch Game in episode 2 for impersonating Queen Elizabeth II, and was eliminated in episode 4 after losing a lip sync to Karen from Finance.
Unlike a regular season of the original U.S. RuPaul's Drag Race, no Miss Congeniality was crowned by RuPaul in the series; however, a poll of the eliminated queens in post-show interviews with the entertainment website PopBuzz saw Anita Wigl'it named as their choice for Miss Congeniality.
She currently co-hosts the Kita and Anita's Happy Hour podcast alongside Kita Mean.
She was one of nine queens to compete in the first season of "Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World". Despite winning Snatch Game in her original season, she was in the bottom 2 for her Snatch Game impression of Adele in episode 2. She was eliminated in episode 3 by Silky Nutmeg Ganache.
