0,"Capers C. Funnye Jr. (; born April 14, 1952) is an African-American Conservative rabbi, who leads the 200-member Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation of Chicago, Illinois, assisted by rabbis Avraham Ben Israel and Joshua V. Salter.
Born in Georgetown, South Carolina, he moved with his family to Chicago. He became interested in Judaism while in college at Howard University and has gone through two conversion rituals. He has led efforts to coordinate with both Black Hebrew Israelite groups and mainline Judaism.


== Early life and education ==
Capers Funnye Jr. was born in 1952 in Georgetown, South Carolina in the Low Country, with paternal ancestry among the Geechee people (or Gullah) of the Sea Islands. They are an ethnic group that kept strong African traditions. Variations of his surname are common in Nigeria and West Africa.
His family moved to Chicago as part of the Great Migration of African Americans to industrial cities out of the South. He grew up on the South Side. There he got to see more of his mother's extended family in Chicago, including future First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama, his first cousin once removed. His mother Verdelle (Robinson) Funnye was a sister of Fraser Robinson Jr., Michelle (Robinson) Obama's paternal grandfather; their family also was from Georgetown and had Gullah ancestry.
Funnye was raised in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination. At 17, he was encouraged by his minister to enter the clergy. Dissatisfied with Christianity during his college years at Howard University and influenced by movements for civil rights and black nationalism, he investigated other religions, including Islam. After meeting with Rabbi Robert Devine, the spiritual leader of the House of Israel Congregation in Chicago, which practiced a kind of Messianic Judaism, Funnye joined his congregation. Related Black Hebrew Israelite movements in the United States had started in the late 19th century in Kansas.
Funnye became drawn to the ""more conventional teachings of a black, Brooklyn-based rabbi named Levi Ben Levy, the chief rabbi of the International Israelite Board of Rabbis. This group has its roots in the Commandment Keepers Congregation of the Living God, founded in 1919 by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in Harlem. It incorporated in 1930 and later moved to Brooklyn, where Matthew established a seminary. After Matthew's death in 1973, there had been little dialog with white Jewish congregations, who disagreed with Black Hebrew Israelite claims of historic descent from ancient Israel. Funnye studied long-distance with Levy for five years, and Levy ordained him in 1985 through the Israelite Rabbinical Academy of Brooklyn, founded by Matthew. The academy does not have ties to any mainstream Jewish denomination.
With the goal of building bridges to United States Judaism, in 1985 Funnye undertook a second formal conversion to Judaism that was certified by a Conservative rabbinical court. He had also studied Judaism more intensively in Chicago, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Jewish Studies and Master of Science in Human Service Administration from the Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies there. Funnye has said that he felt a sense of intellectual and spiritual liberation in the constant examination that Judaism encouraged.


== Marriage and family ==
Funnye married Mary White of Chicago. Her brother Frank White Jr. is a businessman who served on Barack Obama's national finance committee during his first presidential campaign.


== Career ==
In 1985, Funnye was selected as assistant rabbi at Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Chicago; with 200 members, it is now one of the largest black synagogues in the United States. Its congregation is mostly African American. Funnye is the first African-American member of the Chicago Board of Rabbis, and serves on the boards of the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs and the American Jewish Congress of the Midwest. In 1996, Funnye was the only black rabbi in the Chicago area.
Funnye has been active in the Institute for Jewish and Community Research, reaching out to historically black Jewish communities outside the United States. These include the Beta Israel in Ethiopia, which are formally recognized by Israeli authorities as Jewish, and the Igbo Jews in Nigeria, which are not.
Funnye's current congregation was founded by Rabbi Horace Hasan from Bombay (now Mumbai), India, in 1918 as the Ethiopian Hebrew Settlement Workers Association. Along with African Americans, members include Hispanics and whites who were born Jews; the majority of the congregation has converted to Judaism. As is traditional with Judaism, the congregation does not engage in missionary activity. Members who want to convert must study Judaism for a year before undergoing a traditional conversion, requiring men to be ritually circumcised and women to undergo ritual immersion in a mikvah. The synagogue is ""somewhere between Conservative Judaism and Modern Orthodox"" with distinctive African-American influences; while men and women sit separately as in Orthodox synagogues, a chorus sings spirituals to the beat of a drum. The congregation occupies a synagogue built by an earlier Ashkenazi congregation in the Marquette Park neighborhood. Funnye says they have not applied to belong to any mainstream synagogue organizations, as they do not feel the need.
In 1995, Funnye was a co-founder, with Michelle Stein-Evers of California and Robin Washington of Boston, of the National Conference of Black Jews. Washington is also Jewish and is the editor of the African-American newspaper, Bay State Banner.  They have worked to broaden the conversation among black Jews and Black Hebrews across the country, as well as to build bridges to conventional Judaism, made up predominately of whites. Funnye said, ""I am a Jew, and that breaks through all color and ethnic barriers.""
On April 2, 2009, Funnye was invited for the first time ""to speak at a white, mainstream synagogue in New York"", at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, a Reform congregation. He called it his ""Broadway debut"". The congregation had reached out to black Jewish congregations to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and about one-quarter of the audience were black Jews. Funnye spoke about King and Barack Obama, the night before the latter's inauguration as president. The next day he and his family went to Washington to join the Obamas in inaugural events.
In October 2015, Funnye was installed as Chief Rabbi of the International Israelite Board of Rabbis. In August 2016, he was inaugurated to that position. The board is made up of ""people who identify themselves as Black Jews or Israelites.""

1,"Samuel Adler (December 3, 1809 – June 9, 1891) was a leading German-American Reform rabbi, Talmudist, and author.


== Early life ==
Samuel Adler was born on December 3, 1809, in Worms, Confederation of the Rhine (present-day Germany). He received his early religious education from his father Isaac, who was one of the associate rabbis in Worms and instructed him in Hebrew and the Biblical and Rabbinic literature of the Jews. When Rabbi Isaac Adler died on December 23, 1822, thirteen-year-old Samuel, his four young siblings, and their mother were left in straitened circumstances. In spite of innumerable difficulties and extreme privation, Samuel continued his studies at the yeshivot in Worms and Frankfurt-am-Main, while concurrently pursuing a regular course of classical and general studies at the high schools of those two cities.
After graduating from the Frankfurt Gymnasium, Adler entered, in 1831, the University of Bonn and later that of Gießen, where he studied Oriental languages and philosophy for five years and awarded the Doctor of Philosophy in 1836.


== Career ==
Adler assumed his first official appointment as a preacher and assistant rabbi in Worms. In 1842, he was elected rabbi of the Jewish congregations in Alzey and remained in this position until 1857.
In 1856 Adler removed to United States at New York City, and at the beginning of 1857, he received an offer from Temple Emanu-El, New York to succeed Leo Merzbacher, recently deceased, as the head rabbi of the leading Reform congregation in the United States.  Adler accepted the call and moved to New York in March 1857.  He remained active as the spiritual head of Emanu-El until 1874, when he was made rabbi emeritus and relieved from active work for the rest of his life.  He was succeeded by Gustav Gottheil.  During his tenure, Adler continued the practice of conducting Temple services in German, in preference to the traditional Hebrew, for the congregation that consisted mostly of prosperous German immigrant families.  Adler also revised the German prayer book introduced by Merzbacher. He also authored the bi-lingual A Guide to the Instruction in the Israelitish Religion (Leitfaden für den israelitischen Religionsunterricht) for use in Emanu El's Hebrew Sunday school.
Samuel Adler was not merely a thorough Talmudic scholar, but also had a considerable command of the knowledge of various issues concerning the Jews, including their history, religion, and literature.  Adler was committed to translating his scholarship into social action.
During the twenty-one years of his career in Germany, he campaigned energetically for the emancipation of the Jews from their civil disabilities, especially for the removal of the humiliating and obnoxious oath known as the more judaico.  Adler succeeded in having the Jewish religion taught on equal terms with Protestantism and Catholicism in the lower and higher schools of Worms.  He pushed for the recognition of gender equality within Judaism.  It was through his influence that the mechitza, which had segregated the women from the men in the ancient synagogue of Worms, was leveled, allowing the sexes to sit with each other during services.
Adler gave special attention to the improvement of the religious instruction of the young, both in the city and in the rural schools he supervised.  He made it his aim to enhance the order, the solemnity, and the dignity of the public worship.  He was instrumental in founding a number of new charitable institutions. Above all, with patience and zeal, he persuaded his congregations to let go of the deadening influence of religious literalism. In this endeavor he frequently drew upon the storehouse of his great Talmudic learning for the arguments which he used in his struggle for progress, seeking always to rest the reformation of manners upon a basis of inward conviction, and favoring a gradual transformation rather than an abrupt transition from the old to the new.
He belonged to what may be called the historico-critical school of Jewish theology. He was a highly-respected citizen of New York, keeping in touch with modern thought and progress, and accomplishing a vast amount of good. He contributed scholarly articles to several learned periodicals; for example, Contributions to the History of Sadduceeism, Jewish Conference Papers, and Benedictions. Some of these the author collected and published under the Hebrew title, Kobez 'al Yad (Collections) in 1886, mainly as a souvenir for his friends.


== Death and legacy ==
Adler died on June 9, 1891, in Manhattan, New York, and rested in Salem Fields Cemetery of Brooklyn, New York. His extensive library of rabbinica was donated by his family to Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati.


== Family ==
Adler married Henrietta Frankfurter.

His son Felix Adler (1851–1933), was the founder of the Society for Ethical Culture.
His son Isaac Adler was a physician and educator.
His daughter Sarah Adler Goldman, married to Julius Goldman (1852–1909), German Jew of the Goldman–Sachs family.
His grand-daughter Hetty Goldman (1881–1972), was one of the first female archaeologists to undertake excavations in Greece and the Middle East.

== Early life and education ==


=== Family Origins ===
Abadie's parents were forced to flee Aleppo, Syria, where his family had lived for millennia, under government pressure. Abadie explained his parents' flight from Syria:
“My parents lived right next to the synagogue. They saw people enter the synagogue, pillage it, torched it, took out the Torah scrolls and holy books and burnt them. My parents escaped from their home through the backdoor as people tried to get into my parents’ house. They left and never returned.”
Abadie was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1960. The Abadie family moved to Mexico City in 1971 after the Palestinian Liberation Organization relocated its headquarters from Jordan to Lebanon. They lived in Lebanon with no citizenship, as registered refugees, with identity documents reading ""stateless."" Abadie's father, had his picture posted on walls around Beirut claiming he was a Zionist leader, prompting his family's emigration.
After moving to the United States in 1979 to attend Yeshiva University, he earned his B.A. in Health Sciences in 1983, B.S.C. in 1984 in Bible Studies, Hebrew Teacher's diploma in 1985, and a master's degree in Jewish Philosophy in 1986 from Bernard Revel Graduate School of Yeshiva University. Abadie received his ordination in 1986 from Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. He attended SUNY Downstate Medical Center, where he graduated in 1990 with an M.D. degree. He did his residency in Internal Medicine, and later his fellowship in gastroenterology at Maimonides Medical Center where he finished in 1995.


== Tenure as rabbi ==
Abadie became a rabbi at Congregation Beit Edmond in 2001.
He was the founding rabbi of Shaare Mizrah-Manhattan East Synagogue, the Head of School of the Sephardic Academy of Manhattan, and the Spiritual Leader of the Moise Safra Community Center in Manhattan. From 2003 to 2017 he was the founding Rabbi and Spiritual Leader of the Edmond J. Safra Synagogue in New York City (now Congregation Beit Edmond), one of the largest Sephardic synagogues in New York City.
He is currently the President of JJAC (Justice for Jews from Arab Countries) and a member of the governing council of the World Zionist Organization (WZO). He is the founder of the Sephardic Academy of Manhattan and served as the Director of the Jacob E. Safra Institute of Sephardic Studies, at Yeshiva University and college professor of Sephardic Judaism, history, philosophy, and comparative traditional law.


=== Senior Rabbi in the United Arab Emirates ===
In November 2020, after the signing of the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between the UAE and Israel, Abadie moved to Dubai to become the country's Senior Rabbi. 
In 2021, Abadie issued an official condemnation of the Houthis for imprisoning a Yemenite Jew, Levi Salem Marhabi, for helping smuggle a group of Jews into Israel; dubbing it as a crime against humanity.


== Personal life ==
Abadie's native language is Arabic and is fluent in six languages. He is also a part-time gastroenterologist. Abadie has received the Orden Del Merito Civil, the highest civil decoration in Spain. He has been married to Elise Eichler for over 36 years.

3,"Menahem Shemuel Halevy (Hebrew: מנחם שמואל הלוי; lived 1884–1940) was a prominent Iranian Rabbi of the early 20th century.  He fought against persecution in Iran and wrote numerous books.
Halevy served the Jewish Congregation of Hamadan, first in Iran and later in Jerusalem, as a Rabbi, a Judge and an educator. While in Hamadan, he held the position of a teacher in the Alliance Israélite Universelle, and later as its principal. Moreover, he was the Jewish congregation's civil leader and representative to the Municipality of Hamadan. As the spiritual shepherd of his people, he insisted on teaching everyone the Hebrew language, the respect of the Torah and the love of the homeland, Zion. Being a gifted writer, he published poetry books, essays and historical books, both in Hebrew and Persian, of the Jews of Iran in general and of Hamadan in particular.


== Activism in Iran ==
Halevy fought for the rights of the Jews of Hamadan, and his influence reached high places in government; thus, saving many of his brethren from imprisonment, torture and even death. Being simultaneously a pragmatist and an idealist, he believed that his participation as a representative to the Municipality of Hamadan would assure the Jews some security from arbitrary persecution at the hands of the Shiites, and in spite of his young age he headed the Jewish congregation.
Moreover, Halevy was committed to finding people who had left Judaism, and return them to the Jewish faith. He fought zealously against Jewish assimilation and conversion to Islam and to the Baháʼí Faith, which was popular at this time. Under his influence many converts, mainly from Mashhad, returned to Judaism. For that he was recognized by the Alliance Israélite Universelle in Paris. He dedicated all his efforts for this purpose, writing pamphlets, giving sermons, Sabbath after Sabbath, in the synagogue, and establishing various societies with the purpose of saving and returning the lost souls from their forced conversion back to Judaism.
Through his speeches and poetry Halevy implanted in the heart of his listeners the love for the land of their forefathers. His zeal and love of Zion echoed in his weekly sermons and motivated many Iranian Jews to return and settle in Israel. He was known by Jews from all over Persia as a phenomenal religious orator and as a Zionist leader, protecting the civil rights of the Jews. His charisma and oratorical power to move crowds to tears and to belief in the Jewish religion and the Zionist principles became legendary. He was notorious for his passionate speeches and he mesmerized the crowd with his words and stamina to tears.


== Life in Israel ==
As soon as he arrived in Israel he was deemed to be one of the leaders of the Iranian congregation. He led the Iranian congregation and was a leading member of Vaad HaSephardim, and the Histadrut Haluzei HaMizrachi of Jerusalem. A year and a half after arriving in Israel, in 1924, the Vaad Haleumi of the Jews of Eretz Israel, appoints him as a judge in the Hebrew Courts. His talent of persuasion influenced many organizations to seek his help in raising money and souls for Israel. He is sent as an emissary by Keren Hayesod and HaMizrachi to Aden (Yemen), Aram Naharyim (Mesopotamia), Beirut, Sidon (Lebanon), Damascus, Egypt, and India, where he meets with Mahatma Gandhi trying to persuade him of the right of survival of the State of Israel in the Holy Land. Wherever he went he received written praise for persuading the Jews to return to the Holy Land and to contribute for the cause of Israel.
The Mizrachi Organization World Central on February 3, 1939, sent Rabbi Menahem their gratitude for establishing a Mizrachi branch in Bombay. They also acknowledge the importance of his meeting with Gandhi, and express the hope that the meeting with Rabbi Menahem might have opened Gandhi's eyes and change his negative attitude about Israel and the Jews.
In his poems Rabbi Menahem expresses his deepest love for Zion. His love for Zion was political, nationalistic and religious. It's the Promised Land from where the people of Israel were exiled and to where they were promised to return.
The trip to India negatively affected his health, and upon return, exhausted and worn out, he became ill. He died in 1940 at the age of 54.

4,"Rabbi Menachem Mendel Monsohn (Hebrew: מנחם מענדל מאנזאהן‎; October 13, 1895 – September 3, 1953) was a member of the Monsohn family of Jerusalem, born in the Old City of Jerusalem. He was a great-grandson of Abraham-Leib Monsohn, one of the founders of the Ashkenazi Old Yishuv of Jerusalem in the early nineteenth century, and a son of Abraham-Leib Monsohn II, a founder of the A.L. Monsohn Lithography in Jerusalem.
 After marrying, Monsohn lived with his family in the Batei Broide section of Nachlaot, Jerusalem, which provided housing for rabbis and their families. In 1924  Monsohn immigrated to the United States with a group of rabbis from Eretz Israel, settling in Brooklyn, New York, where he served as rabbi of Congregation Ezrath Israel on Gates Avenue, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section, until his death in 1953. His book, Mi-Peninei Ha-Rambam: Bi’ur ‘al ha-Torah, a compendium of Maimonides’ commentaries on the Pentateuch, arranged by the compiler in order of the Torah chapters, first appeared in Brooklyn c.1925 and was reprinted there several times in the early 1930s. In 2006 it was re-released by Mossad Harav Kook of Jerusalem, which also published an English translation, Pearls of the Rambam (tr. Avraham Berkovits) c. 2008. Some of the early editions included a Yiddish introduction to the life of Maimonides.


== Expanded description ==
Monsohn’s intellectual prowess became apparent at an early age: at 16 he received rabbinical ordination (semikhah) from Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the first Ashkenazic chief rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine; diverging from his usual practice, Rabbi Kook gave Monsohn an approbation to be published in his Mi-Peninei Ha-Rambam. To earn a living, for a while Monsohn worked at the lithographic press established in Jerusalem by his father and uncle. But he objected to the press's printing of a calendar for one of the Jerusalem churches and he quit the press. After establishing himself as a rabbi in Brooklyn, New York, Monsohn brought his wife, Zipporah Yehudit (Chipe, née Silberman, a descendant of Yitschak Shatz/Schwartz and Baruch-Mordechai Schwartz, who immigrated to Jerusalem from Nesvizh in the early 19th century) and their Jerusalem-born children, Eshke (Esther Schwartz, wife of Max Schwartz), Shmuel (Samuel Stanford Manson), Shimon (Simon Manson), and Chaya Masha Gitl (Marsha Bunis, wife of Jacob Bunis) to Brooklyn; their daughter Raytse (Rose Aronson, wife of Matthew Aronson) was born there.  In Brooklyn, Monsohn eked out a living, devoting most of his time to work on his Mi-Penine Ha-Rambam, which he printed himself, using the skills acquired at his father’s press. In all editions of his book—published in Hebrew (as מפניני הרמב""ם) in Brooklyn, New York in 1932, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1939 and in Jerusalem in 2006, and in English (as Pearls of the Rambam) in Jerusalem, 2008—Monsohn noted that he was born in Jerusalem.

Freundel's career came to a sudden end in October 2014 when he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and charged with committing voyeurism of several women in a mikveh (Jewish ritual bath). Kesher Israel immediately suspended him without pay and later notified the congregants that he had been fired. Similarly, he was also suspended from membership in the Vaad and the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), the main professional association for Modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States. He also was suspended from his multiple academic positions. He was assistant professor of rabbinics at Baltimore Hebrew University, where he was the rabbinic studies graduate program adviser, associate professor at Towson University and adjunct lecturer at the Georgetown University Law Center. Towson University immediately opened its own administrative review of Freundel's conduct with students, while Georgetown University began its own investigation as well.
Freundel ultimately pleaded guilty to 52 counts of voyeurism and was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison and fined $13,000. On August 28, 2018, the $100 million class action lawsuit which had been brought on behalf of the victims against Freundel and the organizations he was associated with was dropped in lieu of a settlement of $14.25 million, to be paid by the insurance of the parties named in the suit. He was expected to be released on August 21, 2020, but was released early on April 1, 2020, due to COVID-19.


== Education ==
Freundel earned a Bachelor of Science at Yeshiva College with a double major in chemistry and physics, along with a concurrent B.S. from the Erna Michael College of Hebraic Studies. He received a Master's degree in Talmudic studies from the Bernard Revel Graduate School and his semikhah (rabbinic ordination) from Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), part of Yeshiva University. He earned his Ph.D. at the Baltimore Hebrew University.


== Career ==

Freundel served congregations in Great Neck, New York, Norwalk, Connecticut and Yonkers, New York    before assuming the pulpit at Kesher Israel, a prestigious Washington synagogue located in the capital's exclusive Georgetown neighborhood, whose members have included Cabinet secretaries and Members of Congress.
Freundel had been an adjunct at a number of universities in the past, including American University and the University of Maryland, College Park.
As a writer and lecturer, Freundel addressed topics ranging from environmentalism to Jewish medical ethics. He had served as a visiting scholar at Princeton, Yale and Cornell and guest lecturer at Columbia and the University of Chicago. Due to his congregation's proximity to Georgetown University, he lectured at that institution with particular frequency. Similarly, his proximity to Capitol Hill had facilitated his participation in governmental affairs as a consultant and commentator.
Freundel served as consultant to the Ethics Review Board of the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health and consultant to the United States Presidential Commission on Cloning (May 1997).
In the past, he had served as pre-rabbinics advisor and assistant director of synagogue services at Yeshiva University (August 1986 - June 1989), as a member of Yeshiva University's Rabbinic Alumni Association Executive Committee, and as a vice-president of the RCA, whose conversion committee he headed.
Freundel appeared on the episode of Da Ali G Show entitled ""War.""


== Voyeurism charges and conviction ==


=== Arrest, arraignment and investigation ===
On October 14, 2014, police took Freundel from his synagogue-owned residence in handcuffs and, pursuant to a search warrant, removed computers and other items from the premises. One day later, Freundel was arraigned and charged with six counts of voyeurism, a misdemeanor, for allegedly filming women while they were undressing before immersing themselves in the National Capital Mikvah, an independent facility that Freundel was instrumental in founding in 2005. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sharon Marcus Kurn told the judge that Freundel ""violated the laws up in the heavens and down,"" but he pleaded not guilty to these initial charges and was released on his own recognizance under condition that he stay away from and have no contact with the synagogue and the mikvah, which are located in adjacent buildings.
The police acted after the National Capital Mikvah's lay leadership handed them a suspicious clock radio the rabbi had placed in the shower room at the mikvah, a ritual bath that is used as part of the conversion ritual, by married Orthodox women following menstruation and childbirth and by some Orthodox men before the onset of the Sabbath and major Jewish holidays. ""Upon receiving information regarding potentially inappropriate activity, the Board of Directors quickly alerted the appropriate officials,"" it noted in a statement published upon Freundel's arrest and suspension. ""Throughout the investigation, we cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so."" A witness told the police that Freundel was observed placing the clock radio in the mikvah shower room and, when he was discovered doing so, he claimed that he was repairing the ventilation. A police inspection of the clock radio found that it contained a video camera whose memory revealed surreptitious recordings of six different women changing — and moving images of Freundel himself setting up the camera. Detectives said that as many as 200 women could have been recorded without their knowledge. A forensic examination determined that several media storage devices found in Freundel's home contained copies of videos backed up from the camera's memory card.

According to a search warrant, Freundel may not only have set up spying and recording devices at his synagogue and at the mikvah, but also at Towson University. A search of Freundel's Towson office revealed several small cameras hidden in everyday items, multiple computer storage devices, and a list of handwritten names.
On November 12, district prosecutors told a D.C. Superior Court judge they needed more time to investigate and determine if there were additional victims. The court was informed that a web site was being created in order to reach other victims. On January 16, 2015, the prosecution requested another one-month delay to complete their review of all the video evidence obtained from computers seized by police in the hope to identify additional victims.


=== Reactions ===
""We are appalled by the accusations against Rabbi Barry Freundel and wish to stress that the acts attributed to him are atrocious and strictly against Jewish law,"" a spokesman for the Chief Rabbinate of Israel stated.
The day Freundel was arrested, the president of the RCA, Rabbi Leonard Matanky, revealed that the Council investigated allegations earlier in the year that related to ""ethical issues that came up regarding an issue with a woman,"" but no action was taken. That may have been a reference to overnight train rides Freundel booked in May 2013 to and from Chicago, where he supposedly was to ""conduct research."" It later transpired that he had traveled on both legs of the round-trip journey with a woman who was not his wife, with whom he shared a private sleeping berth.
On October 20, the RCA issued a press release stating that it discovered in 2012 that Freundel had coerced conversion candidates into performing clerical work at his home and contributing money to his rabbinic court. The RCA also was able to confirm that he shared a checking account with a conversion candidate. At the time the RCA did not view these activities as rising to the level that would require Freundel's suspension, but did suspend him once he was arrested and, together with its affiliated Beth Din of America, launched its own investigation led by Allen Fagin, the chief professional at the Orthodox Union, and Eric Goldstein, CEO of the UJA-Federation of New York.
Under the leadership of the synagogue's president, Elanit Jakobovic, the synagogue directed all its attention to the victims of his actions by arranging a support group led by a licensed psychologist and consultations with therapists, as well as organizing a closed-to-the-media community meeting with Cathy L. Lanier, Washington's chief of police. Two days after Freundel's arrest and suspension, Jakabovics addressed a packed synagogue at Shemini Atzeret services, declaring: ""These sacred spaces — our shul and our mikvah — have now been tarnished. Our inviolability has been violated. Kesher and the mikvah will be a safe place again.""
Freundel's arrest also sparked widespread debate about how mikvaot should be supervised, administered and protected from predators. Bethany Mandel, a writer who was converted by Freundel (and who he secretly filmed in the Georgetown mikvah on at least two occasions) proposed a ten-point ""Bill of Rights"" for converts. She was soon named, together with another female convert, to a new RCA committee charged with reviewing the entire conversion process, and was later chosen as one of The Forward 50 in recognition of her initiative. Rabbanit Chana Henkin, the founder and head of Nishmat, the Institute for Advanced Jewish Studies for Women in Jerusalem (who once spoke on the topic of ""Women and the Future of Judaism"" at Freundel's synagogue), called for a new generation of religiously educated women to take control of the mikvaot.


=== Lawsuits ===

On December 2, 2014, a student at Georgetown University Law Center, where Freundel taught a seminar on Jewish law, filed a lawsuit against Kesher Israel Congregation, Georgetown University and the National Capital Mikvah. The unnamed student had written a term paper on the mikvah, which received an ""A"" from Freundel, who had convinced her to immerse herself at the mikvah on two occasions, both of which she presumes he filmed. She sought class action status and claimed that the defendants turned a blind eye and failed in their responsibility to protect students from the rabbi, whose behavior she claimed was becoming ever more bizarre, and who was mistreating women subjected to his authority. On December 18, a student at Towson University identified only as ""Stephanie"" added her name to the lawsuit, claiming that Freundel encouraged her to take a ""practice dunk"" in the mikvah as part of her studies, even though she was not Jewish and had no interest in converting. She was joined by Emma Shulevitz, a woman who had been converting to Judaism under Freundel's auspices and who had likewise been encouraged by him to take a ""practice dunk,"" an anomaly that he said would help prevent any misstep on the day of the conversion. They added the RCA as a defendant as well.
The plaintiffs claimed that the RCA and Freundel's synagogue were aware of his inappropriate conduct before the cameras were discovered in the ritual bath he supervised. They charged that the RCA and Kesher Israel should have removed Freundel from his positions of authority and that his alarming actions included inviting non-Jewish women to use the mikvah and inventing and encouraging the use of ""practice dunks."" In response, RCA issued the following statement: ""The RCA has conducted itself appropriately and is taking important steps to improve its conversion protocols. We will defend ourselves vigorously in this matter."" Kesher Israel responded with this statement: ""Kesher Israel's leadership is deeply concerned about the harm caused by Rabbi Freundel's actions — of which we did not and could not have known — and for the personal welfare of all those individuals who may have been violated. The lawsuits that were recently filed are completely without merit. Our energies remain focused on working towards healing our community and building a vibrant future for Kesher Israel.""
In 2015, a congregant brought lawsuit against Freundel for allegedly transferring tens of thousands of dollars from her personal bank account into accounts of his own and in name of some of his children. She claimed she gave Freundel power of attorney when she traveled abroad and asked him to ensure should anything happen to her, she would have a Jewish burial. She also believed he used her apartment as a safehouse where he filmed at least one victim of domestic violence. While she was preparing an appeal in this litigation, she died and there was no one to continue the litigation on behalf of her estate. Right before her death, she was distraught that the rabbi's wife claimed in a deposition that she barely knew her, when she viewed the Freundels as her closest family.
Lawsuits against Freundel and defendants began to gain steam in June 2016, when the Superior Court of the District of Columbia issued an order outlining the consolidation of claims against Freundel. Sanford Heisler, LLP was appointed interim class counsel by the court, and co-counseled with the D.C. law firm of Chaikin, Sherman, Cammarata & Siegel, P.C., which filed one of the first class action lawsuits against Freundel, Kesher Israel, the National Capital Mikvah, and the Rabbinical Council of America in December 2014. On August 16, 2016, the lawsuit was amended to add an additional defendant, the Beth Din of America.
On October 22, 2018, the D.C. Superior Court approved a $14.25 million class action settlement. According to the terms of the finalized settlement, women identified as having been videotaped by Freundel were entitled a base payment of $25,000. A $2,500 base payment was available to women who used the mikvah but were not confirmed as having been videotaped, and who suffered emotional distress after learning of Freundel's actions. Class members were also entitled to supplemental payment based on their individual experiences.


=== Plea bargain ===
On February 11, prosecutors informed victims that of all the women appearing in the recordings seized from Freundel's home and office, only 152 could be positively identified from headshots submitted to the police department via email in the preceding weeks. Since evidence collection was conducted passively, with the Metropolitan Police accepting reports rather than seeking them out, many more women who had been recorded did not submit photographs to be considered for purposes of prosecution (or, in the case of students, mistakenly submitted them instead to campus police). Moreover, an untold number of recordings seized in the initial raid had been deleted and were not reconstructed by police. No charges were pursued for criminal trespass in connection with the rabbi's unauthorized use of the mikvah for unlawful purposes nor in connection with his transport of the recordings or of women for sexual purposes across state lines.
Several dozen recordings of the 152 women positively identified fell outside the criminal statute of limitations. A handful of women requested not to have charges brought in connection with the recordings of them. Charges were brought per victim rather than per recording, so that multiple recordings of the same victim were treated as one count. All of the foregoing had the effect of whittling down the counts of voyeurism ultimately filed against the Rabbi to 88. Despite longstanding court procedures designed to protect the identity of victims of sexual assault, Assistant U.S. Attorney Amy Zubrensky cautioned victims against a trial, warning that it could expose the graphic recordings to the jury and media as well as opening them to cross-examination. Instead, Freundel would be offered a plea bargain that would not exclude the possibility of incarceration.
The plea bargain was delivered to Freundel's attorney on February 18. In a court hearing the next day, Freundel pleaded guilty to 52 counts of voyeurism, one for each woman (not per instance of recording) whom prosecutors identified as having been recorded during the previous three years and who had not declined to have charges brought on her account. Assistant U.S. Attorney Zubrensky noted that in addition to the camera in a clock radio, Freundel had recorded women using mini-cameras embedded in a tissue box and a table-top fan. In addition, he surreptitiously videotaped a domestic violence abuse victim in the bathroom and bedroom of a safe house that he had established for her so she could escape her husband's violence.


=== Sentencing ===

Ronald Machen, then the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, indicated that he would push for a harsh sentence. ""Bernard Freundel exploited his position of power to victimize dozens of women who entered a sacred, intimate space of religious ritual,"" he said. ""We will be seeking a prison sentence that reflects the gravity of this disturbing assault on the privacy and dignity of so many victims.""
The statutory maximum punishment is a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 on each of the first 30 counts and $1,000 on the remainder.
A week before the sentencing, prosecutors submitted a 25-page memorandum to Judge Geoffrey M. Alprin requesting a prison term of 17 years, or four months on each of the 52 counts. In his 12-page response, Freundel's defense attorney asked that his client be spared prison time and sentenced instead to community service. ""He has already been punished in that he has lost his employment as a rabbi and is never likely to be so employed again,"" Freundel's lawyer wrote. ""He has been publicly humiliated and his prior reputation as a Judaic scholar, teacher and counselor have been destroyed.""
On Friday, May 15, 2015, Freundel was sentenced by Judge Alprin in front of a packed courtroom to six-and-a-half years in prison and fined $13,000. ""You repeatedly and secretly violated the trust your victims had in you, and you abused your power,"" Alprin told Freundel, in handing down the punishment. Beforehand, 18 of Freundel's victims testified about their emotions. ""He lectured us about the evils of porn while turning us into his own porn stars,"" one victim told the court, choking back tears. Another said she fell into a deep depression and began using drugs. ""I fell off the edge of this earth,"" she said. Seven others took the stand on his behalf, several  of whom claimed that he was now a changed man. ""It tears my guts out to think of the innocent people I've traumatized,"" Freundel, for his part, told the court, reading from a prepared text. ""I am sorry.""
""Today the court heard the heart-wrenching accounts of the victims of Barry Freundel's exploitation,"" noted Acting U.S. Attorney Vincent H. Cohen, Jr. of the District of Columbia, in announcing the court's decision. ""Their stories make clear the lasting scars that will be left by this outrageous abuse of power. This prosecution was an effort to restore the dignity that Barry Freundel tried to steal from these women. We hope that the scores of victims of his crimes will find some solace in the justice meted out by the court today.""
""It is my hope that the many victims in this case draw a small measure of relief from the sentencing action today,"" added Metropolitan Police Chief Lanier. ""His actions wounded an entire religious community and showed a flagrant disregard for his position of trust within that community. I am confident that today's action by the courts will serve to continue the healing process for the many unwitting victims of this predator.""
Prosecutors later revealed that among the videos Freundel stored at his residence were several he made of himself in ""sexual situations"" with other women, many of whom may have been unaware that the liaisons were  being recorded.
Freundel was taken from the courtroom to the D.C. Jail, where he was put in isolation for 23 hours a day due to threats against him. He appealed his sentence, claiming that he should have been punished only for a single videotaping, but his appeal was rejected by Judge Alprin on July 31. A second attempt to have his sentence reconsidered, made to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, was filed on June 21, 2016 but was unanimously rejected on September 15, 2016, by the three-man panel.


=== Aftermath ===
After reviewing the criminal complaint, search and arrest warrants, accompanying affidavits, as well as relevant halakha with respect to the status of prior conversions, the RCA declared that all conversions Freundel had performed until his arrest were valid. After an initial hesitation on its part, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel agreed, but warned that if Freundel were to attempt to perform any conversions in the future, they would not be recognized.
When he was unanimously fired by Kesher Israel's board on November 24, 2014, Freundel was given a grace period until January 1, 2015, to vacate the synagogue-owned rabbinic residence, but one month after the deadline passed he still had not done so. As a result, Kesher Israel referred the matter to the Beth Din of America, asking that it order Freundel to move out, return all synagogue property, compensate the congregation for his occupancy of the house beyond the January 1 deadline, and cover the costs of the arbitration. He finally vacated the house on March 3, leaving it in a state of disrepair that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate. This litigation, however, did not involve Freundel's wife, Sharon, who moved out less than three weeks after his arrest. He acceded to her request for a get (a Jewish divorce document) shortly afterwards.
Freundel resigned from his tenured position at Towson University one week after pleading guilty. While he was under suspension he continued to draw a salary, which totaled $30,830.
Freundel was named by The Jewish Daily Forward to its ""list of the 50 American Jews who have had the most impact on our national story"" in 2014. In explaining his inclusion, the newspaper wrote that ""It's hard to imagine a more disturbing violation of a sacred Jewish space than the one of which Orthodox rabbi Barry Freundel is accused."" The Israeli newspaper Haaretz ranked the ""Peeping Rabbi"" as number 1 on its list of ""Ten scandals that rocked the Jewish world in 2014,"" and noted that it did so ""because the idea that any rabbi might (allegedly) use hidden cameras to spy on women in their most sacred place like the ritual bath and exploit the vulnerability of conversion candidates to Judaism is unfathomable.""
In July 2015 an RCA review panel of six men and five women (including two converts) that was established in the wake of Freundel's arrest released a list of nine recommendations to guide the conversion process. These focused on  ""support for conversion candidates during and after their conversions, professionalism, transparency of expectations, sensitivity to candidates, educational experiences, the responsibilities and support for rabbis and rabbinic judges, and oversight, supervision, and grievance processing.""
Freundel issued a public apology for his ""heinous behavior"" and ""perverse mindset"" on September 8, 2015, the eve of the Jewish High Holy Days, which are marked by repentance and forgiveness for sins.
In July 2017, a morality play by a local Washington-area playwright, entitled ""Constructive Fictions,"" which was based on the Freundel scandal, ran at the Gallaudet University theater.
On April 18, 2018, an automated email was sent to those of Freundel's victims who had signed up for updates on the criminal case against him, notifying them that he would be released from prison on August 21. The next day, however, the D.C. Department of Corrections sent a correction, admitting that the previous email was a mistake. Freundel was expected to be released on August 21, 2020, after receiving a one-year sentence reduction due to good behavior. However, he was released early on April 1, 2020, due to COVID-19.


== Positions ==


=== Abortion ===

Freundel believed that according to the halakha, abortion is only permitted when a woman is in ""hard travail"" and her life is in danger. This is a very limiting position, Freundel pointed out, since there must be serious danger to the mother. This does, however, also include cases where there is significant psychological trauma, wherein continuing the pregnancy could inflict significant or mortal harm to the mother in that fashion (such as a rape victim who becomes suicidal). Freundel believed that there is no way, under Jewish law, to allow partial-birth abortion, since once the head has emerged, the baby is considered to be born.


=== Cloning ===
Freundel saw two issues with cloning humans from a halakhic perspective. The first is whether cloning is allowed, and the second is whether a clone would be considered a human being.
He did not view cloning as being prohibited by halakha, and even saw ""becoming a partner with God in the works of creation"" as a noble goal. He did, however, support regulation, and at a hearing urged the United States Congress not to prohibit human cloning, but rather to regulate it. He argued that human knowledge and technology are inherently neutral, and it's what's done with them that is important.

Human beings do the best that they can. If our best cost/benefit analysis says go ahead, we go ahead. ""God protects the simple"" is a Talmudic principle that allows us to assume that when we do our best God will take care of what we could not foresee or anticipate. If things do not work out, the theological question is God's to answer; not ours.
Freundel strongly maintained that a clone would be considered a human being under Jewish law.


=== Homosexuality ===

Freundel published an article entitled Homosexuality and Judaism in the Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society. In it he argued that there is no category for ""homosexual"" in halakha. A homosexual then is no different from any other Jew who has committed a sin. Since Freundel viewed homosexuality as an activity rather than a state of being, he advocated the kiruv approach - trying to make a less observant Jew more observant by following halakha.

Judaism rejects the suggestions that homosexuality is either a form of mental illness or an 'acceptable alternate lifestyle.' Judaism's positions would be a third and as yet unconsidered option. Homosexuality is an activity entered into volitionally by individuals, who may be psychologically healthy, which is maladaptive and inappropriate.


=== Modern Orthodoxy ===
Freundel wrote in a published article that ""Modern Orthodoxy is not doing very well, because people are not living by its guiding principles. Even those who identify with the movement do not view the world through fealty to halakhah followed by modern modification.""


== Published works ==
Freundel was the author of two books, eight journal articles and many op-eds.

6,"Baruch Korff (July 4, 1914 – July 26, 1995) was an American Orthodox rabbi. He was a longtime Jewish community activist who was associated with the Irgun and Lehi groups. Korff was a close political confidant of Richard Nixon, and was known as ""Nixon's rabbi.""


== Early life ==
Baruch Korff was born on July 4, 1914, in Novohrad-Volynskyi present-day Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire). He was the second child of Grand Rabbi Jacob Israel Korff and Gittel Goldman Korff, in a family that was part of an unbroken line of rabbis that went back 73 generations. In 1919, anti-Jewish pogroms swept through Eastern Europe Korff family found themselves caught in the middle of one such pogrom. Gittel fled her home carrying an infant in her arms, with Korff and two other young children following her. Gittel was killed, and Korff witnessed the murder. He would forever label himself a coward for not attempting to save her. Korff wrote in his memoirs that ""My life ever since has been a quest for redemption from that charge."" His father was suspected of committing treason and fled to Poland. Korff later followed him there, remaining in Poland for seven years while studying in its yeshivas. In 1926, he emigrated to the United States, where he celebrated his bar mitzvah.
Korff studied in the Yeshiva Ohr Torah, Yeshiva Torath Chaim, and the Yeshiva Rabbi Isaac Elchanan. In 1934 he was ordained a rabbi, following in the footsteps of his ancestors. He was the headmaster of the Yeshivah Torath Emeth in Brooklyn, New York from 1936 to 1937. He later became the rabbi for the Congregation Hayim Solomon from 1938 to 1940.


== Activism ==
Korff became an adviser to the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the U.S. and Canada. He was also an advisor to the U.S. War Refugee Board. He was also the director of the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe, and later became an active member of the Political Action Committee for Palestine. Korff was also a Zionist.
Korff was active in the anti-Nazi movement prior to and during World War II. Korff was the director of the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People during World War II. He was responsible for gathering over 1,000 rabbis to march in Washington, D.C. in order to persuade Britain to allow Jewish immigration to Palestine after the war.
In 1947, in the aftermath of the Exodus incident, and the dismay of many in the nationalist camp that the British government was prohibiting large-scale Jewish migration to Mandatory Palestine, Korff led a Lehi (Stern Gang) plot to firebomb the Foreign Office in London in protest. He traveled to Paris and offered money to a decorated member of the United States Army Air Forces, Reginald Gilbert, to fly the plane that would first drop leaflets, then drop the bombs. It was necessary to involve Gilbert due to the fact that neither Korff nor any of the Stern Gang members were themselves pilots. Gilbert feigned acceptance of Korff's offer, but immediately turned informant, notifying the American Embassy in London, who in turn alerted the Paris police and Scotland Yard to the Stern Gang's planned attack on London. The authorities convinced Gilbert to go along with the plan, and after a week Korff was arrested and indicted for masterminding the plot. Held in La Santé Prison, Korff staged a 17-day hunger strike in protest even slipping into a coma, until he was revived. Eventually, all charges against him were dropped and he was released. Korff was also part of Menachem Begin's underground movement in the 1948 Palestine war. 


== Rabbinical career and later life ==
In 1950, Korff became the rabbi of a Temple Israel located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He served in that capacity for three years until he worked as a rabbi in Taunton, Massachusetts, where he stayed from 1954 to 1971. During this time, Korff was also a chaplain at the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health.
In 1983, Korff moved to Providence, Rhode Island upon taking a job position as a consultant at Brown University. In his later years, he appeared as a panelist on the Sunday-morning show Confluence. Korff died on July 26, 1995, due to pancreatic cancer.


== Relationship with Richard Nixon ==
Korff first met Richard Nixon during his 1967 presidential campaign. Korff became an active supporter of Nixon, despite Nixon's known anti-Semitism. He defended Nixon during Nixon's growing unpopularity over Watergate. In 1974, Korff had founded the National Committee for Fairness to the Presidency, the purpose of which was to reaffirm ""Our faith in God and country, in Constitutional government, in the presidency, and in our beloved President."" The committee made several newspaper ads that promoted Nixon as president. Korff even held a three-day event of fasting and prayer on Nixon's behalf, and was active in raising money to help with Nixon's growing legal expenses. Korff also met with Nixon on August 6, 1974, in order to convince him not to resign from office. Nixon later stated that Korff ""spoke with the fire of an Old Testament prophet"" when  he tried to convince Nixon to fight to stay in office. The rabbi told Nixon that ""You will be sinning against history if you allow the partisan cabal in Congress and the jackals in the media to force you from office."" After the president left office, Korff continued to visit him. He also established a trust fund to help pay off Nixon's legal fees, which totaled over $155,000. Korff retired from raising funds for Nixon in May 1975.
Many American Jews were embarrassed at Korff's behavior. However, he did receive support from Yitzhak Rabin and Golda Meir. Korff later admitted that what Nixon did in the Watergate Scandal was wrong, but continued to stand by him.
Korff met with Nixon on May 13, 1974, after which he wrote the book The Personal Nixon: Staying on the Summit. During spring of the same year, Nixon had referred to Korff as his rabbi.


== Personal life ==
Korff married Naomi Ruth Sternburg on October 25, 1942. The couple had two children; however, they divorced in 1952. He was later married to Rebecca Marshall in the mid-1960s. Their only daughter is named Zamira. This second marriage also ended in divorce.
Korff was the uncle of Grand Rabbi Yitzhak Aharon Korff.

7,"Baruch S. Lanner (born October 20, 1949) is an American former Orthodox rabbi who was convicted of child sexual abuse.


== Career ==
Lanner was the principal of Hillel Yeshiva High School in Ocean Township, New Jersey and later the director of regions for the Orthodox Union's National Conference of Synagogue Youth (NCSY).


== Crimes ==
In 2000, an investigative series published in The Jewish Week alleged that Lanner had physically and sexually abused young kids for decades. Lanner resigned the day after it was published. The story, ""Stolen Innocence,"" later won an award for ""meritorious journalism.""
An investigation was conducted by the Orthodox Union (OU). The investigating committee, headed by then-Hillel President Richard Joel, spent over $1 million interviewing more than 140 people and issued a 330-page report detailing the abuse. The report alleged that Lanner had physically, sexually and emotionally abused dozens of teenagers, including fondling girls and kneeing boys in the groin, and that the abuse had begun in 1970. As a result of the report, the executive vice president of the OU, Rabbi Raphael Butler, resigned. He had been criticized for failing to act on earlier complaints.
Lanner was convicted in 2002 of sexually abusing two teenage girls who attended the religious school where he had been principal, and sentenced to seven years in prison. An appeals court dismissed one of the child endangerment charges in 2005. He was released on parole on January 10, 2008, and was given parole for four years.


== Aftermath ==
A second report commissioned in 2001 by the OU found that the abuse had been overlooked for decades, despite multiple complaints, and that ""profound errors of judgment"" had been made, including failures of management. The case has been described as ""well-publicized"" and a ""watershed in the way the Orthodox community addresses sexual abuse"".
In 2003, the members of the Beth Din that had investigated Lanner in 1989, Rabbis Mordechai Willig, Yosef Blau, and Aaron Levine, apologized to the victims for not acting to stop the abuse. Blau was singled out by Willig for counseling victims over the years.


== Move to Israel ==
In June 2022, Lanner flew to Israel under the guise of tourism and requested Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return. The Israeli government awarded Lanner temporary legal residency.
On July 19, 2022, Minister Ayelet Shaked announced that Israel would not be offering citizenship to Lanner in light of his convictions in the US. He remains in Israel under a temporary visa.

9,"The Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies, informally known as the ""Ziegler School"" or simply ""Ziegler"", is the graduate program of study leading to ordination as a Conservative rabbi at the American Jewish University (formerly known as the University of Judaism).
Founded in 1996, it was the first independent rabbinical school located on the U.S. West Coast. It ordained its first class in 1999.
Located in Los Angeles, it has ordained more than 200 rabbis; about half of them women. The school attracts an international student body, with students from Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Israel, Mexico, Uganda, and the United Kingdom, as well as from every region of the United States. Upon ordination, Ziegler rabbis serve in every sector of the United States and Israel. Ziegler rabbis are automatically admitted to the international Rabbinical Assembly.
The Ziegler School program requires students to participate in a year abroad in Israel.
The Ziegler School ordained only two students in 2021. In 2022, it slashed tuition by 80%, with the stated goal to attract more students and make rabbinical school more accessible. In 2023, after AJU sold off their campus in Bel Air, the Ziegler School relocated to an office building in Pico-Robertson.
In March 2024, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency revealed that AJU had hired law firm Cozen O'Connor to investigate complaints of gender-based misconduct at the Ziegler School. The complaints, made over the previous two decades by former rabbinical students, allege a pattern of male favoritism and disrespectful treatment by dean Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson and deputy dean Rabbi Cheryl Peretz, who were notified of the investigation by a Cozen O'Connor attorney. Artson and Peretz are also the subject of a probe by the Rabbinical Assembly over a similar set of allegations. According to the JTA's article, a report from AJU is forthcoming.

11,"David Feuerwerker (October 2, 1912 – June 20, 1980) was a French Jewish rabbi and professor of Jewish history who was effective in the resistance to German occupation the Second World War. He was completely unsuspected until six months before the war ended, when he fled to Switzerland and his wife and baby went underground in France. The French government cited him for his bravery with several awards. After the war, he and his wife re-established the Jewish community of Lyon. He settled in Paris, teaching at the Sorbonne. In 1966, he and his family, grown to six children, moved to Montreal, where he developed a department of Jewish studies at the University of Montreal.


== Early life ==
He was born on October 2, 1912, at 11 Rue du Mont-Blanc, in Geneva, Switzerland. He was the seventh of eleven children. His father Jacob Feuerwerker was born in Sighet, now Sighetu Marmației, Maramureş, then Austria-Hungary, now Romania. His mother Regina Neufeld was born in Lackenbach, one of the famous seven Jewish communities or Sheva Kehillos (Siebengemeinden) in the Burgenland, Hungary, now Austria. The family moved to France because Jacob was unable to work as a shochet, a trained ritual slaughterer, in Switzerland.
In 1925, he completed his primary school education at the Rue Vauquelin Talmud Torah school in Paris, and after receiving his baccalauréat in science, literature and philosophy, he entered the rabbinical school Séminaire israélite de France in 1932. Beginning in 1933, he simultaneously studied Semitic languages at the prestigious École pratique des hautes études, where he received the Diplôme de l’EPHE, a postgraduate degree. Among the languages he spoke were Aramaic and Syriac. He became a naturalized French citizen in 1936, and was ordained a rabbi on October 1, 1937.


== Second World War ==


=== Military service and recognition ===
From October 15, 1937, until September 1, 1939, he served in the French Army, in Alsace. After World War II broke out, he remained in the army until July 25, 1940. He was in charge of communications for a group of artillery of the 12th R.A.D. (Régiment d'Artillerie Divisionnaire) and chaplain of the 87th D.I.A. He was demobilized at Châteauroux on July 25, 1940.
He received the Croix de guerre 1939-1945 (France) with a bronze star.
The citation to the Order of the Brigade reads as follows:

As chief of artillery communications has participated from September 1939 to February 1940 in the engagements in Alsace in the region of Bitche. Has shown drive, courage, and competence in assuring under fire the phone and radio contacts.

A second citation for the Croix de guerre 1939-1945 (France) was to the Order of the Army, with palm.


=== Rabbi of Brive and of three départements ===
In 1940, he was nominated rabbi of three French Departments: Corrèze, Creuse, and Lot, based in Brive-la-Gaillarde. He lived at Villa du Mont-Blanc, avenue Turgot, in Brive. He created his first Study Circle (Cercle d'Etudes).
The Jewish population consisted of numerous refugees, including a large segment originating from Alsace and other regions occupied by the Nazi invader. He helped numerous of them to find a country of refuge, with the help of the oldest agency dealing with refugees in the United States, the HIAS. Among the destinations, Cuba. For himself, there was no thought of leaving France, since he was a community leader. He succeeded in liberating many internees from transit camps in France, including the camp at Gurs. He helped Benoit Mandelbrot in the pursuit of his studies.


=== In the Résistance ===
In Brive with Edmond Michelet, later to be a senior minister under Charles de Gaulle, he participated actively in the French Résistance Movement ""Combat"" against the Nazi occupation. His name in the French Résistance was ""Jacques Portal"". He received the Croix du combattant volontaire 1939–1945, the Medaille Commémorative de la Guerre 1939–1945 with the bar ""France"".
He was to be made Knight (Chevalier) of the Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) for his military activities.

Despite the exceptional risks which were attached to his ministry, has participated in an active, permanent and unselfish way to the organisation of the resistance in all the region.
Has not hesitated to risk his freedom, and without any doubt his life, to be for the Movement ""Combat"" an auxiliary particularly serious.

It's to him that many hundreds of resistants owed their false identification papers which allowed them to escape the searches by the Gestapo.
His wife, Antoinette Feuerwerker (née Gluck), who had finished law school in Strasbourg before the war, and whom he married at the beginning of the war, participated with him in the underground. Combattant Volontaire de la Résistance, in 1944 she was awarded the French Liberation Medal (Médaille de la France Libérée), ""for her participation in the liberation of France"".


=== Jacques Soustelle and the passage to Switzerland ===
Six months before the end of World War II, the Germans finally understood that the Rabbi of Brive was an active member of the Résistance. But the Rabbi got ahead of the occupier. After receiving reliable information that he was on the list of people to be arrested by the Gestapo, he decided to act. His arrest and his probable disappearance would not advance the cause he defended, day after day. He took the difficult decision, in agreement with his spouse, Antoinette Feuerwerker, to leave Brive. Only one destination was possible, Switzerland.
Antoinette Feuerwerker obtained from Jacques Soustelle, a future minister of Charles de Gaulle and later his opponent, but then a leader of the Résistance, information how to reach clandestinely neutral territory, in Divonne-les-Bains. Once in his native city of Geneva, he was imprisoned by the Swiss authorities. But his life was not in immediate danger. Once Lyon had been liberated, in which he participated, he resumed the task of rebuilding the Jewish community of Lyon and of France, then in disarray.
Antoinette Feuerwerker had remained in France for the last six months of the war. In order to evade the Germans and deportation, she went underground with her baby daughter, Atara. Once the war ended, the couple reunited in Lyon, for the adventure of reconstruction of the post-war French Judaism.

His activities included liaising with the former Prime Minister of France, Édouard Herriot and the Roman Catholic primate of the Gauls, Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier, later, recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations, by Yad Vashem, Jerusalem, Israel.
He published in Lyon, the first weekly Jewish newspaper since the war, called L'Unité (""Unity"").


== Post-War ==
In 1946, he was elected rabbi in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris, where he established a Cercle d'Etudes (Study Circle) at 12 rue Ancelle. The money destined for the Aliyah Bet ship Exodus was hidden, without his knowledge, by his wife, Antoinette Feuerwerker, under his bed, since no one would suspect him.
In 1948, he became rabbi of Les Tournelles, the Great Synagogue in Paris. In the Cercle d'Etudes du Marais he formed at 14 Place des Vosges, in the heart of Le Marais, the lecturers included: Raymond Aron, Robert Aron, Henri Baruk, le Père Marie-Benoît, Jean Cassou, Georges Duhamel, Marcel Dunan, Edmond Fleg, Henri Hertz, Louis Kahn, Joseph Kessel, Jacques Madaule, Arnold Mandel, Szolem Mandelbrojt, François Mauriac, Edmond Michelet, Pierre Morhange, François Perroux, le Père Michel Riquet, Pierre-Maxime Schuhl, André Spire, Jean Wahl, and many others.
In an assessment of ""European Jewry Ten Years After The War"", and of France, in particular, Arnold Mandel writes in 1956: ""Under the auspices of a very dynamic, forceful and militant rabbi David Feuerwerker a free debating club the Circle du Marais has been active for several years. Situated in one of the most beautiful squares in Paris, the Place des Vosges where the Victor Hugo Museum is located, the club, where the discussions are sometimes stormy, is one of the liveliest and most picturesque spots in the Jewish quarter of the French capital. It is Hyde Park with more spirit.""
Roger Berg writes en 1992 on the Cercle d'Études du Marais: ""Sometime after the end of World War II, and before the sudden emergence of television in homes, study circles were created all over, the most prestigious among them was the Circle of the Marais of David Feuerwerker."" The French Jewish Community paid tribute to him, on December 23, 1956, on the occasion of his twentieth year in the Rabbinate and of the two hundred and fiftieth Session of the Cercle d'Etudes du Marais, to as it specified, Honor the guide and the master whose activity is creative and efficient for the Jewish Community of France.

12,"David J. Steiner (February 2, 1965 – December 26, 2016) was an American documentary filmmaker, educator, rabbi, real estate investor, mediator and political activist, best known for the documentary film Saving Barbara Sizemore (2016).


== Early life ==
David Jay Steiner was born in Chicago, Illinois to a Jewish family, and was raised in nearby Lincolnwood, Illinois. His parents, Robinn Schulman, a nurse whose family owned the company that manufactured Shane Toothpaste (now known as AloeSense), and Joseph Steiner, a figurative painter and art instructor, divorced when he was young, but maintained an amicable relationship. As a youth, he began a lifelong affiliation with Habonim Dror, the labor Zionist youth movement.


== Education ==

Steiner was educated in Lincolnwood, Illinois area public schools until his sophomore year of high school, when unaccompanied by his family, he moved to Israel. In accord with his socialist values, he lived in the kibbutz community of Hakfar Hayarok. On the kibbutz, Steiner was assigned to the dairy, and was put in charge of the artificial insemination and midwifery process for cows. For the rest of his life, Steiner would incorporate bovine imagery into his work; he really loved cows. Steiner served in the Israel Defense Forces and fought in the 1982 Lebanon conflict.
Steiner attended the University of Illinois-Chicago (UIC), and then the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) where he studied film, and, taking after his father, painting. As a painter, he was devoted to the styles of expressionist painters such as Alice Neel and  Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, as well as his father. He continued and further developed his political activism while living in Los Angeles and as a film student, took the actor and political activist Edward Asner as his mentor.
Steiner learned his style of filmmaking in film school at UCLA.
Steiner was drawn to film and comedy. He was strongly influenced by the comic tradition of Jews in America—the Marx Brothers, borscht belt stand-up comedians, Woody Allen and Lenny Bruce, to name a few. Of all things, Steiner was a non-conformist and an experimental visionary, like another one of his heroes, Frank Zappa. These influences would influence Steiner's later work—both his cinematic work and his writings.
As and adult and well in his late 40s, Steiner completed his doctorate in education at the National Louis University in Skokie, Illinois.  Steiner undertook rabbinical studies at the Shalom Hartman Institute, the Hebrew Seminary of the Deaf and the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism.  On November 7, 2017, he was posthumously ordained a rabbi by the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism at a ceremony in Farmington Hills, Michigan.


== Career ==
After earning his art degree at UCLA, Steiner returned to Chicago and soon thereafter moved back to Israel, where he married and had three children.  He continued his creative efforts in Israel, developing CD-ROM and video content for a multimedia company, Hed Arzi Music, and teaching. Steiner strongly believed that the best way to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict was to find ways to get Israeli and Palestinian youth together to create art, play sports and have constructive dialog, so he started an organization that brought together Israeli and Palestinian youth.  It was at this time that Steiner's son befriended some refugees from South Sudan, which formed the inspiration for the documentary Steiner was working on at the time of his death in Africa in 2016.
Upon his return from Israel, Steiner and his family settled in Skokie, Illinois, where Steiner tackled many projects simultaneously. He created educational software products, and invested in residential real estate. Several of his properties were located in the Humboldt Park neighborhood of Chicago, where Steiner started a book club for homeless individuals in that area. During this time, Steiner also served as director of the religious school at Congregation Solel in Highland Park, Illinois, and completed his doctoral degree in education at National Louis University.  Steiner also wrote a number of screenplays at this time.
However, becoming a rabbi was important to Steiner, and he was given the opportunity to study at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, so the family returned to Israel. The return was short-lived, as the economic crisis of 2008–2009 resulted in the reduction of the endowment upon which Steiner's rabbinical program was funded. So the Steiners returned to the United States, this time to Tarzana, California, where Steiner assumed the position of director of education at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, California.
After a year in California, Steiner returned to Chicago, as his marriage ended in divorce.  Soon after though, he met Diane Kliebard Silverberg, an attorney. Coincidentally, Silverberg  was the daughter of Herbert Kliebard, a noted historian of education at the University of Wisconsin, who was a great influence on Steiner's academic work in the education field. Silverberg and Steiner eventually became engaged, and together, the two traveled to a number of faraway locations where Steiner was invited to speak and lecture, including Hong Kong.  The two also traveled together to Israel, Morocco, Spain, Canada, Cuba, and the United Kingdom. He also gave lectures in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  During this time, Steiner resumed his rabbinical studies at the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism, as well as extensive training as a mediator. Upon completion of his mediation studies, he started Third Eye Mediation, his professional mediation practice.
While attending a mediation conference in Chicago, Steiner met Jonathan Speller, an administrator at the Barbara A. Sizemore Academy, an afrocentric charter school on the South Side of Chicago. Speller invited Steiner to the school for a Kwanzaa celebration; the school fascinated Steiner, and he decided to apply his film skills to teach children attending that school to make a documentary film.  This became the basis for Saving Barbara Sizemore, Steiner's 2016 documentary.


== Film ==


=== Saving Barbara Sizemore ===

Steiner's documentary Saving Barbara Sizemore was released in the U.S. on August 27, 2016, at the Capital City Black Film Festival in Austin, Texas.
The film depicts story of the students, teachers and parents of the Barbara A. Sizemore Academy, a charter school in the Englewood area of Chicago. Barbara A. Sizemore Academy serves an African-American community which is economically disadvantaged and beset by violence. The film documents the school's unique methods, which rely heavily on African culture, customs and social structure.
In the fashion of noted documentary filmmaker Michael Moore's classic Roger and Me, Steiner takes a group of school kids to confront School District Superintendent Forrest Claypool and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel about the school district's plans to shut down the school. In so doing, Steiner, who had a doctorate in education, teaches the students not only about how to operate a camera, but also how to use the power of filmmaking as a tool of political advocacy.


=== Untitled Uganda project ===

In the mid-2000s, when Steiner lived in Tel Aviv with his wife and children, his young son had befriended a pair of South Sudanese boys. After Steiner returned to the United States with his family to take an administrative position as an educational director at Valley Beth Shalom in Los Angeles, he learned that these boys were being deported, part of an overall Israeli government program to deport African refugees.
This spurred Steiner to action, and he contacted his friend and UCLA film school classmate, David Bret Egen. He and Egen decided to make a documentary film about the refugee crisis, one that would incorporate the stories of his son's South Sudanese friends into a new documentary, to be filmed in the United States, Israel and Uganda, where the South Sudanese boys were living after their removal from Israel—away from their parents, who were living in war-torn Juba, South Sudan.
Steiner and Egen brought with them Sarah Giroux, a camera operator from Chicago, as well as two of the kids who helped make Saving Barbara Sizemore. In December, 2016, they began production of the Uganda portion of the film. They also screened Steiner's first film at a Ugandan film festival. However on December 26, 2016, Steiner was killed in a bus accident, as their vehicle was hit at high speed by a reckless driver outside of Iganga, Uganda, after the crew attended a holiday party.  The other members of the crew escaped with non-life threatening injuries. As of November, 2017, with the film partially completed, the Steiner family and Egen have taken steps to continue and complete the film, as a tribute to Steiner and his legacy.
The Come True Project, an Israeli charity established to help support the education of South Sudanese refugee children living in Uganda, established the David J. Steiner Scholarships Fund in furtherance of this purpose.


== Writings and political activism ==
David Steiner was a prolific writer of articles, blog entries, screenplays, and academic writings.  His blog, titled The Radish: On The Beet with David Steiner, ran for six years (2008-2014), and in it, Steiner discussed a variety of topics related to causes that where close to him—peace in the Middle East, the refugee crisis, Israeli politics, mediation, baseball, and more.  The name of the blog was derived from the first letters of his name: Rabbi Doctor Shteiner.
Israel was always on the forefront of Steiner's mind, and his writings reflected his advocacy for an inclusive Jewish homeland, one built on democracy, tolerance and progressive values.
Steiner was a regular contributor to eJewish Philanthropy, a resource for Jewish organizations and professionals.  His articles drew upon his vast knowledge of Jewish history, philosophy and liturgy, as well as popular culture and contemporary themes and issues.
Steiner was an early supporter of Barack Obama, and in February, 2007, traveled to Springfield, Illinois in freezing cold weather to watch Obama declare for the presidency at an outdoor event. In the 2016 election cycle, he strongly supported Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. Near the end of his life, Steiner also actively supported protests related to police brutality, more particularly those related to police-involved shootings of unarmed African-Americans.
Among those who noted the passing of Steiner in December, 2016, was Ameinu, the progressive Zionist organization, whose leadership lauded Steiner for ""providing thoughtful writings and event programs that fused Jewish scholarship, Israel education and social justice engagement.""
In 2017, the Barbara A. Sizemore Academy renamed their media studies center the ""David J. Steiner Digital Media Department"", in honor of the man whose film helped save their school. As another posthumous honor, the Chicago chapter of the Center for Conflict Resolution named its annual David Steiner Dedicated Volunteer Award after Steiner, acknowledging that the over 200 disputes he mediated in just two years is a record that likely will never be broken—or indeed, even approached.


== Personal life ==
Steiner had a son and two daughters from a previous marriage. At the time of his death, Steiner was engaged to Diane Silverberg, and the two were living together in Evanston, Illinois. Steiner is buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Skokie, Illinois.  On June 6, 2018, Steiner's son Itamar was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the 40th round of the 2018 Major League Baseball draft.

13,"David Weiss Halivni (Hebrew: דוד וייס הלבני; September 27, 1927 – June 28, 2022) was a European-born American-Israeli rabbi, scholar in the domain of Jewish sciences, and Professor of Talmud. He served as Reish Metivta of the Union for Traditional Judaism's rabbinical school.


== Biography ==
David Weiss was born on September 27, 1927, in Kobyletska Poliana (Кобилецька Поляна, Poiana Cobilei, Gyertyánliget) in Carpathian Ruthenia, then in Czechoslovakia (now in Rakhiv Raion, Ukraine). His parents separated when he was 4 years old, and he grew up in the home of his maternal grandfather, Rabbi Isaiah (Shaye) Weiss, a Hasidic Talmud scholar in Sighet, Romania. 
His grandfather began teaching him at age 5, and he was regarded as an Illui ; he received semicha (rabbinic ordination) at age 15 from Rabbi Yekutiel Yehuda Gross of the town's yeshiva.
In March 1944, German troops arrived in Sighet to deport the town's Jewish population to concentration camps. Weiss, then 16 years old, was sent to Auschwitz along with his grandfather, mother, and sister; his father, Ephraim Bezalel Viderman, was murdered by the Nazis elsewhere. The remaining members of his family at Auschwitz were murdered, leaving Weiss as the sole survivor of his family at age 16. One week after he arrived at Auschwitz, Weiss transferred to the forced labor camps at Gross-Rosen, Wolfsberg, and then Mauthausen, where he worked in a munitions plant.
When he arrived in the United States at the age of 18 after his liberation, he was placed in a Jewish orphanage, where he created a stir by challenging the kashrut of the institution. A social worker introduced him to Rabbi Saul Lieberman, a leading Talmudist at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) in New York, who recognized his brilliance and took him under his wing. Weiss later studied with Lieberman for many years at the JTS.
Initially, he studied in Yeshiva Chaim Berlin under Yitzchak Hutner and was allowed to forgo lectures because of his advanced standing. Over the next decade, he completed high school; earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Brooklyn College; a master's degree in philosophy from NYU, and his doctorate in Talmud at JTS.
He married Zipporah Hager, a descendant of the Vizhnitzer Rebbes, in 1953, and the couple settled in Manhattan. They had three children: Baruch (formally known as Bernard), Ephraim, and Yeshiahu. Halivni had six grandchildren: Avidan, Hadar, Daniel, Rebecca, Benjamin (Jamin), and Eliana.
Weiss, which is German for white, later changed his name to ""Halivni,"" the Hebrew word for white. He died on June 18, 2022, at his home in Jerusalem at the age of 94.


== Academic career ==
For many years he served as a Professor of Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS). He resigned in 1983. Halivni later served as Littauer Professor of Talmud and Classical Rabbinics in the Department of Religion at Columbia University. In July 2005, he retired from Columbia University and moved to Israel, where he taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Bar Ilan University until his death.
Halivni's ""source-critical approach"" to Talmud study  had a major impact on academic understanding and study of the Talmud. The traditional understanding viewed the Talmud as a unified homogeneous work. While other scholars had also treated the Talmud as a multi-layered work, Halivni's innovation (primarily in the second volume of his Mekorot u-Mesorot) was to distinguish between the onymous statements, which are generally succinct Halachic rulings or inquiries attributed to known Amoraim, and the anonymous statements, characterized by a much longer analysis often consisting of lengthy dialectic discussion, which he attributed to the later authors- ""Stamma'im"" (or Savora'im). It has been noted that indeed the Jerusalem Talmud is very similar to the Babylonian Talmud, minus Stammaitic activity, which is to be found only in the latter.
His methodology of source-critical analysis of the Talmud is controversial among most Orthodox Jews, but is accepted in the non-Orthodox Jewish community, and by some within Modern Orthodoxy. Halivni terms the anonymous texts of the Talmud as having been said by Stammaim (based on the phrase ""stama d'talmuda"" which refers to the anonymous material in the Gemara), who lived after the period of the Amoraim, but before the Geonic period. He posits that these Stammaim were the recipients of terse Tannaitic and Amoraic statements and that they endeavored to fill in the reasoning and argumentative background to such apodictic statements.
The methodology employed in his commentary Mekorot u' Mesorot attempts to give Halivni's analysis of the correct import and context and demonstrates how the Talmudic Stammaim often erred in their understanding of the original context.
In Halivni's books Peshat and Derash and Revelation Restored, he attempts to harmonize biblical criticism with traditional religious belief using a concept he developed termed Chate'u Israel (literally, ""Israel has sinned""). This concept states that the biblical texts originally given to Moses have become irretrievably corrupted. Revelation Restored writes as follows:

According to the biblical account itself, the people of Israel forsook the Torah, in the dramatic episode of the golden calf, only forty days after the revelation at Sinai. From that point on, until the time of Ezra, the scriptures reveal that the people of Israel were steeped in idolatry and negligent of the Mosaic law. Chate'u Yisrael states that in the period of neglect and syncretism after the conquest of Canaan when the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours, the Torah of Moses became ""blemished and maculated"".
According to Halivni, this process continued until the time of Ezra (c.450 BCE), whereupon their return from Babylon the people accepted the Torah. It was at that time that the previously rejected, and therefore maculated, text of the Torah was recompiled and edited by Ezra and his ""entourage."" He claims that this is attested in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, and Halivni supports his theory with Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah. He further states that while the text of the Pentateuch was corrupted, oral tradition preserved intact many of the laws, which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details.
This view was seen as possibly being in contradiction to the 8th of Maimonides' 13 principles of faith, which states ""the Torah that we have today is the one that was dictated to Moses by God"". As a result, Halivni's assertions were rejected by some Orthodox rabbis.


== Views and opinions ==
Halivni was involved in the 1983 controversy at JTS surrounding the training and ordination of women as rabbis. He felt that there could be halakhic methods for ordaining women as rabbis but more time was needed before this could be legitimately instituted. He maintained that it was a policy decision by the governing body of the Seminary rather than a psak halachah based on the traditional rabbinic legal process.

Halivni's published works include:

The central thesis of ""Breaking the Tablets"" is that the history of the Jews is ""bookmarked"" by two diametrically opposing ""revelations"": Sinai and Auschwitz. The revelation on Mount Sinai was the apex of God's nearness to the Jews, while the revelation at Auschwitz was the nadir of God's absence from them. Halivni's conviction is that Auschwitz represents not merely God's ""hiding his face"" from Israel, as a consequence of the Jews' sins — a familiar trope in rabbinic theology — but also his actual, ontological withdrawal from human history.
In Breaking the Tablets Halivni explicitly rejected the notion that this withdrawal is simply an example of ""God hiding his face"" as viewed in normative Judaism. The concept of hester panim (God's hiding his face) is classically used with regard to punishment, and Halivni is adamant that the Holocaust cannot in any way be regarded as a punishment for Israel's sins.

17,"Joseph Krauskopf (January 21, 1858 – June 12, 1923) was a prominent American Jewish rabbi, author, leader of Reform Judaism, founder of the National Farm School (now Delaware Valley University), and long-time (1887–1923) rabbi at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel (KI), the oldest reform synagogue in Philadelphia which under Krauskopf, became the largest reform congregation in the nation.


== Early life ==
Joseph Krauskopf was born in Ostrowo, Prussia, on January 21, 1858. In July 1872, at the age of fourteen, Krauskopf emigrated to the United States, expecting to join his older brother, Manaseh, in New Jersey. His brother was murdered just as Krauskopf arrived in the United States and instead he went to Fall River, Massachusetts, where he had cousins. There he found employment as clerk in a tea-store. While not denying or renouncing his own faith, he attended the local Unitarian Church (there was no Jewish congregation in the city), and became a protégé of Mrs. Mary Bridges Canedy Slade, who was the assistant editor the New England Journal of Education, a well-known author and composer, and the wife of the principal of the local high school, Albion Slade. Mrs. Slade directed Krauskopf's self-education, as he could not afford to quit work to attend school. In 1875 Mrs. Slade recommended him to Isaac Mayer Wise who was organizing the first rabbinical class at the newly founded Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. Rabbi Wise probably respected Slade's recommendation because she was a prominent hymnist and author of children's literature. Also writing a letter of recommendation for Krauskopf was William Reed, the editor of the Fall River Daily Evening News. Thus, through the intervention of this devoutly Christian woman, Krauskopf went to rabbinical school.


== Rabbinical education and early career ==
Krauskopf arrived in Cincinnati in 1875 to be part of the first class at Hebrew Union College. This was Krauskopf's first opportunity to enter a program of formal education since arriving in the United States three years earlier at the age of fourteen. Krauskopf spent the next eight years at Hebrew Union College. In this time, he earned a high school degree, a bachelor's degree from the University of Cincinnati, and finally rabbinical ordination from Hebrew Union College in 1883. Therefore, in Cincinnati, he effectively went to high school, college, and rabbinical school simultaneously. While studying at Hebrew Union and at the University of Cincinnati, Krauskopf earned money as a tutor, contributed articles to journals, and published and marketed (with his future brother-in-law, Henry Berkowitz) the Union Hebrew Reader (1881, commonly known as the First Union Hebrew Reader), the Second Union Hebrew Reader (1884), and Bible Ethics: A Manual of Instruction in the History and Principles of Judaism, According to Hebrew Scriptures (1884) (full text). A contemporary journal, which focused on the study of Hebrew language and literature, praised the first Union Hebrew Reader (which sold for 25 cents) for providing ordered lessons that would ""lead to the needed familiarity with the Hebrew page."" In 1899 both of his Hebrew readers were being sold through the ""Educational Catalogue for 1899"" advertised in the publishing industry trade journal, Bookseller, Newsdealer, and Stationer.
While studying for his ordination, Krauskopf served as a student rabbi in Peoria, Illinois, and in Kalamazoo, Michigan. After his ordination, he became the rabbi at Congregation B'nai Jehudah in Kansas City, Missouri. Two years later, in 1885, he finished work on his graduate degree and earned a Doctor of Divinity from Hebrew Union College.
In Kansas City, Krauskopf was enormously popular within his synagogue and the larger urban community. He gave widely attended public lectures, some of which were later published as books. Additionally, he was involved in a wide range of civic activities. The governor of Missouri made him a life-member of the board of what was then known as the National Conference of Charities and Corrections. In 1885 he was instrumental in organizing a convention of reform Rabbis in Pittsburgh. Although only two years out of rabbinical school, he was elected vice-president of the Pittsburgh Conference, of which Isaac Mayer Wise was president. This conference wrote the Pittsburgh Platform, which became the defining statement of Reform Judaism at that time. In July 1887 Krauskopf accepted an offer from Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel of Philadelphia. His Kansas City congregation tried to prevent him from leaving, and even state and local politicians pressured him to reject the offer from KI. A delegation from Kansas City failed in its attempt to get KI to release Krauskopf from his contract. All of this caused some embarrassment and delayed his move, but he finally left for Philadelphia in late October.


== Career at Keneseth Israel ==
Krauskopf was formally installed at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel (KI) on October 23, 1887. Once in Philadelphia, Krauskopf quickly established himself as a leading figure in both the Jewish and non-Jewish communities. Krauskopf's congregation was almost entirely made up of Jews from Germany and other parts of central Europe. From the beginning of KI (in 1847) services and board meetings had always been conducted in German. Krauskopf was from Germany and spoke fluent German. Nevertheless, he transformed KI into an English speaking and thoroughly Americanized house of worship. For example, while continuing to hold religious services on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, Krauskopf also established a Sunday service which followed the traditions of American Protestantism. These Sunday services were more educational than religious, with Krauskopf giving sermons or lectures that lasted more than an hour. He spoke on theology, religion, ethics, social science, natural science and current events. A talented and popular speaker, he drew as many as 1,000 listeners to his Sunday services, including non-members and non-Jews who came to hear him speak. Krauskopf published these sermons and lectures as pamphlets which sold briskly. Under Krauskopf, KI flourished and became the largest reform Jewish congregation in the United States. Following the intellectual lead of his teacher, Isaac Mayer Wise, he was committed to the study of Jewish-Christian relations and even attempted to reclaim the apostle Paul as a model for Judaism. He worked closely with Catholic and Protestant leaders in Philadelphia, and was a force for ethnic and religious pluralism. On a national level, he helped organize the Jewish Publication Society of America, in 1888.
Krauskopf's congregation was almost entirely made up of German Jews. However, at this time, the American Jewish world was being transformed by massive immigration from Russia, Poland, and other parts of Eastern Europe. In 1894 Krauskopf visited Russia to investigate the condition of Jews in that notoriously anti-Semitic nation. Initially the Russian government refused to give him a visa, simply because he was Jewish. This led to a resolution in Congress, proposed by Representative Isidor Rayner of Maryland, urging the United States to abrogate the existing treaty with Russia. Congressman Rayner argued that if an American citizen could not freely travel in a country (Russia), then the United States should not maintain a treaty of friendship with that country. Krauskopf was uncomfortable with this publicity, but later admitted it probably led to Russia finally granting him a visa. While in Russia, Krauskopf gained a first hand look at the condition of the Jews within the Pale of Settlement. Krauskopf met with American diplomats, Russian political leaders and various intellectuals including Leo Tolstoy, best known as the author of War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). Tolstoy told Krauskopf that the Jews had no future in Russia. At Tolstoy's suggestion, Krauskopf visited Jewish agricultural colonies in the Russian Empire and the Jewish Agricultural School at Odessa. On his return he worked to establish a similar institution outside of Philadelphia, believing that it would attract Jews from Russia and help provide them with an education to begin a new life in the United States. By 1895, Krauskopf had raised enough money to start a school, which was established in 1896 as the National Farm School in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The school was non-sectarian, and indeed non-religious, but most of the early students were Jewish. Support came from private donations, state funds, and the Federation of Jewish Charities of Philadelphia. Krauskopf served as the first president of the institution, which is now Delaware Valley University. Krauskopf spent a great deal of time raising money for the school, and in 1905 led a capital campaign that raised $50,000 (about $1.5 million in 2015), including a $12,500 donation from Andrew Carnegie.
When Krauskopf came to KI, the congregation had 250 member families. Within a few years it had over 400 member families. By 1892 the Congregation had moved to a newly constructed impressive building on Broad Street with seating in the sanctuary for over 1600 people. A year later the Congregation hired an assistant rabbi to work under Krauskopf. By 1900, KI's religious school had over 500 students. Under Krauskopf KI abolished the traditional Bar Mittzvah for thirteen-year-old boys and replaced it with a confirmation for boys and girls at age sixteen or seventeen.
Shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Krauskopf became a leader of the National Relief Commission, and was one of three special field commissioners to visit army camps of the United States and Cuba. Almost immediately after he arrived in Cuba, Krauskopf contacted the Jewish philanthropist Nathan Strauss, persuading him to donate an ice factory to support the needs of American troops in Cuba. Two weeks later the entire ice plant was shipped to Santiago, Cuba. In Cuba, Krauskopf became friends with Col. Theodore Roosevelt and conducted services for the eight Jewish soldiers in Roosevelt's Rough Riders (the First United States Volunteer Cavalry). Krauskopf and Roosevelt would remain friends and when Roosevelt died Krauskopf had a large stained glass window commissioned in his honor which today, is part of the entrance foyer in the Keneseth Israel synagogue in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. In March 1903, Krauskopf was elected director-general of the Isaac Meyer Wise Memorial Fund, and in July of the same year he became president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the main professional organization of reform rabbis.
During World War I Krauskopf continued his patriotic public service, working under Herbert Hoover in the U.S. Food Administration. During this period he spent a good deal of time in Washington. He served on the Liberty Loan Committee for Philadelphia and was worked on issues involving food conservation. This dovetailed with his long relationship to the National Farm School.


== Writings and scholarship ==
Krauskopf was a prolific writer. After his ordination he published 14 major books, hundreds of sermons as pamphlets, numerous journal and newspaper articles, and various other publications.
The Jews and Moors in Spain came from a series of eighteen public lectures Krauskopf gave while he was the Rabbi at Congregation B'Nai Jehudah in Kansas City, Missouri. These lectures were initially published in the Kansas City Journal These lectures were enormously popular among ""both Jews and Christians"" and thus Krauskopf consented to their publication in book form. Indicative of their popularity, and the political significance of Krauskopf's interfaith activities, the book had letters of endorsement from Thomas T. Crittenden, the former Governor of Missouri and U.S. District Judge Arnold Krekel.
In his book Evolution and Judaism, Krauskopf accepted the idea that science might ""overshadow"" religion but that the science needs to be well understood and properly connected to religion. Krauskopf accepted the scientific legitimacy of evolution and Darwinian theory. He argued, in a chapter titled ""Darwinism"", that ""Supreme order is the manifestation of supreme intelligence. If I had no other proof for my belief in the existence and sovereignty of an Intelligent Final Cause, I would derive it from my recognition of the fact that supreme order, uninterrupted harmony, eternal and immutable law, control all nature, heaven and earth, all inorganic and organic, in but one way, and in no other."" He argues that evolution is simply part of the law of nature and that ""this natural law shape matter with design and direct force with a purpose, and design and purpose presuppose intelligence."" Krauskopf argued that evolution was the same as ""Supreme Governing Power, Supreme Will, Supreme Natural Law"" and that ""by theologians it is called 'God.'"" With ""this conception of the nature of God"" he argued that ""every difference between science and religion disappears"" and ""with this conception of God, as manifested in nature, I am prepared to accept even Darwinism."" Thus, Krauskopf accepted evolution, as set out by Darwin, as consistent with the existence of God, because God provided the ""supreme intelligence"" to let evolution happen. Under this analysis, there could be no conflict between religion and science, and ""Darwinism, though disagreeing with the Biblical account of creation is with religion, not against it."" He praised Darwin, declaring that ""God has had no better interpreter of the greatness and magnificence of His handiwork."" He acknowledged that Darwin ""opposed"" the ""Biblical account"" of creation, because modern research proved the Biblical account of creation imperfect,"" But Krauskopf argued that this science, and Darwinian notions such as natural selection, actually supported the idea of a superior being – God – who set into motion evolution through natural selection. He concluded that ""Judaism and ever progressive religion with a conception of God ... can freely and conscientiously accept the theory of organic evolution."" Thus, the ""sum of Supreme Will, Supreme Power, Supreme Intelligence, evolutionists name The Reign of Natural Law, the theologians call it God."" Evolution and Judaism is also interesting because, at the same time as adopting a sceptical approach to traditional readings of the bible, Krauskopf attempted to justify Jewish religious continuity by presenting a Jewish form of panentheism that viewed the universe as an evolving phenomenon and presented a biological argument for the reality of life beyond death.
In Jesus—Man or God? Kraukopf argued Jesus was centrally a Jewish scholar and compares his teachings to those of the Jewish philosopher/ scholar Hillel that the historical persecution of Jews was a result of Christianity rejecting, or forgetting, its Jewish and Old Testament origins and in effect, becoming paganized. As a result of this ""the [Christian] church, founded on love and peace and justice, became a church of hatred and inhumanity."" He argued that the Protestant Reformation led to ""the slow return from the pagan Christ to the Judean Jesus, the gradual stripping away of the many foreign-borrowed accretions under which the Nazarene prophet and patriot had well-night been buried"" and thus ""after eighteen hundred years of cruel separation, Christian and Jew are drawing closer to each other."" He argued that ""Unitarian and Reformed Jewish Churches"" were ""the advance guard of both factions have met."" Krauskopf believed that Christianity – and especially the New Testament – had been corrupted by ""foreign material and falsified history, of pagan mythology and Persian demonology and Egyptian mysticism."" He argued that one modern Christianity purged itself of this invasive material Christianity would move back toward its Jewish roots based on ""the Judaism that was taught by a Jewish prophet, and patriot and martyr, the Rabbi of Nazareth.""


== Personal life ==
In 1883 Krauskopf married Rose Berkowitz, the sister of his close friend and intellectual collaborator, Henry Berkowitz. In the same ceremony, Henry Berkowitz married Flora Brunn. The ceremony was conducted by Rabbi Isaac Meyer Wise, who had been the mentor to both men at HUC. The Krauskopfs had three children, Harold, Eleanore, and Manfred, before Rose died in 1893. After her death Krauskopf was absorbed in professional duties and activities, including his trip to Russia and founding the National Farm School. However, during this period he managed to court Sybil Feineman, who was the daughter of Krauskopf's former congregants in Kansas City. In fact, Krauskopf had taught her when she took a confirmation class in Benai Jehuda. In 1896 he went back to Kansas City to marry her, in a ceremony at her parents’ house. The Rabbi was 38 at the time and his new wife was 25. They had one child, Madeleine. In 1923 KI made Krauskopf a rabbi for life, with the expectation that he would retire soon. However, shortly after that, on June 12, 1923, Krauskopf died. 
Members of his family continued his traditions in many ways. His great nephew was Rabbi Malcolm H. Stern, who became an assistant rabbi at KI, published First American Jewish Families (1960, revised 1991), and was the president of the American Jewish Genealogical Society. Rabbi Krauskopf's son, Manfred, served as the president of the board of trustees of the National Farm School, which his father had founded. The Rabbi's grandson, Joseph L. Krauskopf served on the board of trustees of the Farm School and his great-grandson, Joseph Charles Krauskopf, currently serves on the board of the same institution which has evolved into Delaware Valley University.

== Biography ==
Telushkin was raised in Brooklyn and attended the Yeshivah of Flatbush. He was ordained at Yeshiva University and studied Jewish history at Columbia University.


== Life and career ==
Telushkin was raised in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Solomon and Hellen Telushkin. He attended Yeshiva of Flatbush, where he met his friend and future co-author for two books, Dennis Prager, in tenth grade. While at Columbia University, they studied Jewish history and authored Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism and Why the Jews?: The Reason for Antisemitism.
At university, Telushkin was an active leader of the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry. As part of his position, Telushkin visited the Soviet Union, where he met with dissidents such as Andrei Sakharov. He was eventually listed by the KGB as an anti-Russian agent.
An Orthodox rabbi by training, Telushkin served until its closure in December 2022 as Rabbi of the Los Angeles Synagogue for the Performing Arts, founded in 1972 by Rabbi Jerome Cutler. He is an associate of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership and a former director of education at the non-denominational Brandeis-Bardin Institute. Telushkin is also a Senior Associate with CLAL and is a member of the board of directors of the Jewish Book Council. He has been on the Newsweek list of the 50 most influential rabbis in America since 1997.
Telushkin is the author of 16 books on Judaism. His book Words That Hurt, Words That Heal inspired Senators Joseph Lieberman’s and Connie Mack’s Senate Resolution #151 to establish a National Speak No Evil Day in the US, a day for which Americans would go for twenty-four hours without saying anything unkind or unfair about, or to, anyone. His book Jewish Literacy: The Most Important Things to Know About the Jewish Religion, Its People and Its History was one of the best-selling books on Judaism of the 1990s and early 2000s.

19,"Joshua Louis Goldberg (January 6, 1896 – December 24, 1994) was a Belarusian-born American rabbi, who was the first rabbi to be commissioned as a U.S. Navy chaplain in World War II (and only the third to serve in the Navy in its history), the first to reach the rank of Navy Captain (the equivalent of Army Colonel), and the first to retire after a full active-duty career.
He had a highly unusual military background for a U.S. Navy chaplain, having been drafted into the Russian army when he was a teenager, then deserting to make his way to the United States where he enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving in an infantry unit in Europe during World War I before beginning rabbinical school studies in New York City after the war.


== Life and works ==


=== Early life ===
Goldberg was born on January 6, 1896, in Belarus (then part of the Russian Empire), the son of a lumber merchant in Babruysk, and educated in Odessa, Ukraine and Tel Aviv (then part of Palestine).
He was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army when he was 18, serving as a private until deserting his unit to flee Russia after the collapse of the Russian western front.  He was able to reach the United States in 1916, after an eight-month journey by way of Siberia, Manchuria, Korea, and Japan.
He arrived in Seattle and traveled to New York, where he returned to the military, enlisting to serve with artillery units in the American Expeditionary Forces in France during World War I.  He served in the army 1917–1920, leaving as a sergeant.
Goldberg recounted that when the army recruiter who enlisted him discovered that he spoke almost no English, he should ""keep his mouth shut."" Goldberg followed the recruiter's advice, secretly spending ""many an hour at night in the latrine at Fort Slocum, hiding with my [Russian-English] dictionary, trying to maintain my goal of mastering 50 new words every day.""  Once in France, Goldberg's fluency in French was often put to use through service as an interpreter.  In addition to English and French, Goldberg spoke four other languages: Yiddish, German, Hebrew, and Russian.
After the war, he returned to America to teach Hebrew, then began rabbinical studies at the Jewish Institute of Religion in Manhattan, and was ordained in 1926, accepting the position of rabbi at New York's Astoria Center of Israel in 1926.  While serving at the Astoria Center, he made weekly visits to the Brooklyn Naval Hospital to visit service personnel, and later—at the suggestion of one of the doctors at that hospital—he volunteered for service as a Navy chaplain with the outbreak of World War II.


=== Later achievements ===
Goldberg served as president of the Alumni Association for the Jewish Institute of Religion during the 1930s.  He was active in many other organizations and held numerous leadership positions during his career, including: Chaplain of the Department of Hospitals of New York City; Board of Trustees, Queens Public Library; Executive Council, Queens Council of the Boy Scouts of America; Vice President, Queens College Association; Board of Trustees, Jewish Institute of Religion; Board of Governors, Queens Committee for Jewish Social Service; National Secretary, American Jewish Congress; Executive member, Committee of Jewish Delegation in Paris, France; Vice-President, Queens Welfare Committee; and Vice-President, Queens Family Welfare Society. Along with Supreme Court Justice Charles S. Colden, Goldberg ""was instrumental in the establishment of Queens College.""
Goldberg lectured extensively throughout the United States and authored many articles on Jewish and American life.  In 1950, he was named rabbi emeritus of the Astoria Jewish Center.
In 1952, during a visit to Spain, Goldberg (wearing his U.S. Navy uniform) became the first rabbi in 461 years to preach during Jewish services in Madrid, in an ""improvised"" synagogue. When the small community expressed its desire for a permanent rabbi, Goldberg's involvement became a factor in the hiring of Rabbi David A. Jessurun Cordozo in 1953.
In 1961, Goldberg and his wife Henrietta returned from a visit to the Soviet Union to begin writing and speaking on the plight of Soviet Jews, including an article written by Goldberg that was published in Look Magazine, where he wrote that antisemitism was more of a threat to Jews under communism than it had been under the Czars: ""Being a Jew under the Czars was only a disability—not a calamity. Within these restrictions, the Jews developed a rich intellectual, cultural, and most importantly, religious life"".

Now, however, he continues,The Jews are afraid to go to the synagogues lest their children lose their jobs; afraid to complain, lest they be accused of being counter-revolutionaries; afraid to ask for a visa to join families in Israel lest they be accused of participating in Zionist-capitalistic conspiracies; afraid to communicate with relatives in the United States lest they be dubbed potential spies. They have become a community of whisperers in a kingdom of fear.
In 1962, Goldberg served as tour leader for International Conference of Jewish War Veterans in Israel, leading a New York delegation on a tour of sites in London, Paris, Rome, and Israel.


=== United States Navy ===
Upon his commissioning as a U.S. Navy officer on January 8, 1942, Goldberg became the first rabbi accepted as a Navy chaplain in World War II and eventually was promoted to the rank of Navy captain.  He was the first rabbi (Jewish chaplain) to earn this rank, an honor that was especially significant because at that time there were only 18 Navy chaplains holding the rank of captain.  During the war, the Navy sent him to Navy bases around the world as part of a Jewish-Catholic-Protestant chaplain team. ""By conducting interfaith services, he made sure American soldiers and sailors had places to worship regardless of their faith."" The trip—March 8, 1944 – May 20, 1944—covered more than 28,000 miles, including visits to naval installations in the Caribbean, South America, North Africa, and the United Kingdom, and was led by then U.S. Navy Chief of Chaplains Robert Workman.  Following the trip, Goldberg spoke to stateside groups on the importance of ""greater sacrifice"" on the part of civilians back home.
In 1944, Goldberg helped develop a ""practical field training manual"" for theological students being trained to serve as chaplains, and in 1945 the Navy published his 40-page manual, ""Ministering to Jews in the Navy,"" a volume that helped non-Jewish chaplains support the needs of Jewish personnel.  After the establishment of the State of Israel, Goldberg was sent on a visit as a ""special representative of the Chief of Naval Operations—""concerning matters of a delicate nature and with important implications in the area of international understanding.""
Because the Navy had no Jewish chaplain officially attached to the staff of the Chief of Chaplains, Goldberg—as the senior Jewish chaplain in the Navy—served in an unofficial capacity as the Jewish representative to that staff.
After the conclusion of World War II, Goldberg continued to work with chaplains of other faiths, including participation in two NATO conferences on ""building ecumenism among the military clergy.""  In 1960, he became the first Jewish chaplain to receive the Legion of Merit.  He had received five battle ribbons for his earlier service with the infantry.
In 1949, Goldberg was assigned as chaplain to the Third Naval District—the first Jewish chaplain to serve as chaplain for a Navy district—responsible for the coordination of all Navy chaplains in New York, Connecticut, and a portion of New Jersey. His naval career had begun as a member of the staff of the Third Naval District Chaplain January 1942 – July 1949, before serving as the District Chaplain July 1949 – January 1960.
Former Navy Chief of Chaplains Ross Trower wrote that Goldberg was ""chiefly responsible"" for the influential radio program, ""The Navy Goes to Church,"" which ""conveyed to millions of people the concern of the Navy for the spiritual welfare of its personnel.""
From 1950 to 1954 he served as Special Consultant to the Department of Defense Armed Forces Chaplains Board.
Looking back at his Naval career, Goldberg reflected that:

My life in the Navy has been a saga of deep spiritual satisfaction. The Navy Chaplain Corps motto was ""cooperation without compromise"", and that's what it was like. Rabbis, Priests, and Ministers went out together, worked together, and spoke on the same platform. Priests and Protestant Ministers helped arrange Passover services throughout the world. It was not a lessening of stature for us to help each other. We lifted each other up, and helped preserve the dignity of each other's religion. We were practicing ""ecumenism"" long before anyone had heard of the word.


=== Retirement and death ===
As Goldberg's retirement approached, one newspaper article included the following words:

If any man served his country beyond the call of duty, if any man served in a position all the hours of every day, knowing no time off and no private life, that man is Chaplain Joshua Goldberg, who once was called the Religious Diplomat of our time. And this can be said of him that every admiral who ever served over Chaplain Goldberg, that every man who was his Boss, is turning out to honor him on his retirement. It is a rare quality that wins for a sky-pilot the friendship and respect of hard-boiled Navy Admirals. ""Josh"" deserves the love he has gained.
Following his January 1, 1960 retirement from the Navy, Goldberg continued to support military personnel in many ways, including his decision to pay his own expenses in order to travel to Naples for a number of years in a row to lead services for the Jewish High Holy Days for overseas Jewish military personnel. Upon his Naval retirement, Goldberg was appointed assistant to President Nelson Glueck at Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion.
Goldberg retired to West Palm Beach, where he wrote the weekly column ""Wisdom of the heart,"" in the Palm Beach Post.
On December 24, 1994, Goldberg died in West Palm Beach, Florida and was buried on January 6, 1995, in Arlington National Cemetery.  He was 98.

== Family ==
Goldberg married writer and former R.H. Donnelley executive Henrietta C. Davis on August 22, 1948.  Goldberg had two daughters from a previous marriage to Eleanor Rottman - Josephine and Naomi. At the time of Goldberg's death, he and Henrietta had four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
Much of Goldberg's family, including his mother and younger sister, died during World War II in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
He was also a champion level ice skater and trained the Wiener family whilst on vacation in Phoenicia, New York.


== Awards and memorials ==
Goldberg received the Frank Weil Award for ""distinguished contributions to the Armed Services"" in 1958.
That same year, Goldberg received the Gold Medal of Merit from the Jewish War Veterans of the United States.  General Omar Bradley made the award presentation, with remarks by former Secretary of the Navy Charles Thomas and Roman Catholic Cardinal Francis Spellman.
Among his many other awards was the Four Chaplains Award presented by the Alexander D. Goode lodge of B'nai B'rith in 1956. He also received a special ""Medal for International Cooperation"" from the French government, assigning him the honorary rank of commander in the French military.  In 1959, the New York Police Department Shomrim Society honored Goldberg with its first annual ""Person of the Year"" award.
On February 10, 1995, the Captain Joshua L. Goldberg Memorial Chapel was dedicated in his honor at the National Museum of American Jewish Military History in Washington, D.C.

Son of Mario Mordechai Pacifici and Gilda Borghi, Pacifici descended from an ancient Sephardic and religious Jewish family of Spanish origin and of rabbinical tradition settled in Tuscany (first in Leghorn, then in Florence) in the 16th century. After the ""Liceo Classico"" (Classical Studies High School) he attended the University of Florence, where he graduated summa cum laude in Classics (Lettere Classiche) in 1926, and in 1927 he was awarded by the Rabbinical College of Florence—where he had studied under important scholars such as Elia Samuele Artom, Umberto Cassuto, Shemuel Zvi Margulies—the title of Hakham ha shalem (Senior Rabbi).
Pacifici served as Vicerabbi of Venice from 1928 to 1930, director of the Rabbinical College of Rhodes from 1930, Great Rabbi of Rhodes until 1936, Chief Rabbi of the Genoa Jewish Community (Comunità Israelitica di Genova) from 1936 until deported by the Nazis in 1943.
Even during the difficult war years, Pacifici never stopped his spiritual and teaching activity. He continued his rabbinical duties between 1942 and 1943 with the Jewish refugees of the Ferramonti di Tarsia internment camp, located in Cosenza in the region of Calabria.
Unwilling to leave his Genoa Community and thus abandon his remaining members, Rav Pacifici was captured by deceit in 1943 by the Nazis and sent to Auschwitz, where he was murdered with his wife Wanda Abenaim and many other members of the Pacifici family.
The  ""Largo Riccardo Pacifici"" square in the heart of Genoa was named after him in 1966. He was the grandfather of the past Rome Jewish Community President Riccardo Pacifici.

24,"Richard Lowell Rubenstein (January 8, 1924 – May 16, 2021) was a theologian, educator, and writer, noted particularly for his path-breaking contributions to post-Holocaust theology and his socio-political analyses of surplus populations and bureaucracy. A Connecticut resident, he was married to art historian Betty Rogers Rubenstein (deceased 2013).


== Education ==
Rubenstein was born in New York City, on January 8, 1924. He began his tertiary education at Hebrew Union College, an institution within the Reform Judaism tradition. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a B.A. degree. He then was awarded the Master of Hebrew Literature from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Conservative tradition) and was also ordained as a rabbi by that institution. He then studied at Harvard Divinity School and was awarded a Master of Sacred Theology degree. Finally, he pursued doctoral studies and received a Ph.D. from Harvard University, in 1960.
Rubenstein was awarded two honorary doctorates: Doctor of Hebrew Letters, from Jewish Theological Seminary; and Doctor of Humane Letters, from Grand Valley State University.


== Career ==
Following his ordination in 1952, Rubenstein was the rabbi of two Massachusetts congregations in succession, and then in 1956 became assistant director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation and chaplain to the Jewish students at Harvard University, Radcliffe, and Wellesley, where he served until 1958. From 1958 to 1970, he was the director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation and chaplain to the Jewish students at the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie-Mellon University, and Duquesne University.  At the University of Pittsburgh, he also taught an upper division course on French Existentialism.  
From 1970 to 1995, Rubenstein taught in religious studies at Florida State University, where he held a professorial chair. He then became president and professor of Religion at the University of Bridgeport, where he served from 1995 to 1999.
Rubenstein was also a newspaper columnist for a Japanese newspaper and authored several books on the Holocaust, theology, Jewish-Christian relations, ethics, and politics.


=== The Holocaust and death of God ===
Rubenstein emerged in the 1960s as a significant writer on the meaning and impact of the Holocaust for Judaism. His first book, After Auschwitz, explored radical theological frontiers in Jewish thought.  Rubenstein argued that the experience of the Holocaust shattered the traditional Judaic concept of God, especially as the God of the covenant with Abraham, in which the God of Israel is the God of history. Rubenstein argued that Jews could no longer advocate the notion of an omnipotent God at work in history or espouse the election of Israel as the chosen people. In the wake of the Holocaust, he believed that Jews have lost hope and there is no ultimate meaning to life.

[A]s children of the Earth, we are undeceived concerning our destiny. We have lost all hope, consolation and illusion.
In After Auschwitz, Rubenstein argued that the covenant had died. He did not mean he was now an atheist, nor that religion had to be discarded as irrelevant. However, he believed not in a transcendent God, but in God as the ground of being:

Terms like ""ground"" and ""source"" stand in contrast to the terms used for the transcendent biblical God of history who is known as a supreme king, a father, a creator, a judge, a maker. When he creates the world, he does so as do males, producing something external to himself. He remains essentially outside of and judges the creative processes he has initiated. As ground and source, God creates as does a mother, in and through her own very substance. As ground of being, God participates in all the joys and sorrows of the drama of creation which is, at the same time, the deepest expression of the divine life. God's unchanging unitary life and that of the cosmos' ever-changing, dynamic multiplicity ultimately reflect a single unitary reality.
Rubenstein explored what the nature and form of religious existence could possibly comprise after Auschwitz (i.e., after the experience of the Holocaust). He suggested that perhaps the way forward was to choose some form of paganism.
When his work was released in 1966, it appeared at a time when a ""death of God"" movement was emerging in radical theological discussions among Protestant theologians such as Gabriel Vahanian, Paul Van Buren, William Hamilton, and Thomas J. J. Altizer. Among those Protestants, the discussions centred on modern secular unbelief, the collapse of the belief in any transcendent order to the universe, and their implications for Christianity. Theologians such as Altizer felt at the time that ""as 'Death of God' theologians we have now been joined by a distinguished Jewish theologian, Dr Richard Rubenstein.""
During the 1960s, the ""Death of God"" movement achieved considerable notoriety and was featured as the cover story of the April 8, 1966, edition of Time magazine. However, as a movement of thought among theologians in Protestant circles, it had dissipated from its novelty by the turn of the 1970s.


=== Unification Church ===
Rubenstein was a defender of the Unification Church and served on its advisory council, as well as on the board of directors of the church-owned Washington Times newspaper. In the 1990s, he served as president of the University of Bridgeport, which was then affiliated with the church.  Rubenstein said about the church's founder Sun Myung Moon:

I especially appreciated Rev. Moon's commitment to the fight against Communism. From his own first-hand, personal experience and out of his religious convictions, he understood how tragic a political and social blight that movement had been. I had been in East and West Berlin the week the Berlin Wall was erected in August 1961 and had visited communist Poland in 1965. Unfortunately, many of my liberal academic colleagues did not understand the full nature of the threat as did Rev. Moon. I was impressed with the sophistication of Rev. Moon's anti-communism. He understood communism's evil, but he also stood ready to meet with communist leaders such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Kim Il Sung in the hope of changing or moderating their views.


== Other writings ==
Rubenstein undertook a psychoanalytic study of Paul the Apostle in his book My Brother Paul. He continued with Holocaust themes in later writings and adjusted some of his earlier views about God in light of the Kabbalah.

25,"Rabbi Uri Zohar (Hebrew: אורי זוהר‎ [ˈuʁi ˈzoaʁ]; 4 November 1935 – 2 June 2022) was an Israeli film director, actor and comedian who left the entertainment world to become an orthodox rabbi.


== Biography ==

Uri Zohar was born in Tel Aviv. His parents were Polish Jewish immigrants. In 1952, he graduated high school and did his military service in an army entertainment troupe. His first marriage, to singer Ilana Rovina, ended in divorce.
In 1960, he studied philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was sentenced to three months of community service on charges of marijuana possession. In the late 1970s, under the influence of Yitzhak Shlomo Zilberman, Zohar turned to religion, becoming a Haredi Orthodox Jew and a rabbi.
He was a close friend of Arik Einstein, with whom he made some of his most noted films. Einstein's two daughters married Zohar's sons.
Zohar was one of the founding members of Ma'ale Amos. Later, he resided in Jerusalem.
He died at the age of 86 on 2 June 2022. He was survived by his second wife Eliya Shuster, a former actress who had participated in a film he directed, their seven children and numerous grandchildren.


== Entertainment and film career ==

After his discharge from the army, Zohar became one of the founding members of the theatre and entertainment troupe Batzal Yarok, which was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the 1960s, Zohar directed and starred in Israeli films, among them Hole in the Moon, Three Days and a Child, Every Bastard a King, Big Eyes and Metzitzim. He directed 11 full-length films as well as a number of short movies and episodes of the television series ""Lool"" (Chicken Coop). When Israel Television went on air, he became a program host and appeared in commercials.
In 1977, he began wearing a kippa on the television game show he was hosting. He eventually withdrew entirely from Israel's popular culture scene to become a Haredi Jew and began to study in yeshiva. He became a rabbi in Jerusalem and immersed himself in Biblical scholarship. He became active in the movement to attract secular Jews to religious orthodoxy, and used his entertainment skills to promote this objective. In the 1992 Israeli elections, Zohar directed the television broadcasts for the Shas party. He later directed a film about a successful dancer who embraces orthodox Judaism, mirroring his own story. The film was a success with Ultra-Orthodox audiences. Zohar had enlisted the help filmmakers Dani Rosenberg and Yaniv Segalovich to make it, and Rosenberg and Segalovich in turn made a documentary about him.
When asked in an interview about how he regarded his former career in entertainment, Zohar said that ""I respect it, the way a mature adult remembers his childhood. But there's no escaping the fact that I was a child.""


== Awards and recognition ==

In 1976 he was awarded the Israel Prize for cinema, which he declined.
In 2012, Cinémathèque Française in Paris held a retrospective of Zohar's work. The event included lectures and screenings of all his major films. Zohar was described as one of Israel's most interesting film directors due to his exploration of manhood and machismo, male-female relationships and the impact of the military.


== Personal life ==
In the early 1960s, Zohar was married to the singer Ilana Rovina for about two years. Later he married Alia Shuster, an actress who starred in the movie ""Big Eyes"" that he directed.
Zohar and Alia, who lived in Jaffa after getting married and later became religiously observant and moved to Jerusalem, had seven children. His two oldest sons, Ephraim Fishel and Shalom, married the daughters of Alona and Arik Einstein, Shiri and Yasmin, who also became religiously observant. The wedding of Ephraim Fishel and Shiri was documented in Renan Shor's 1985 short film ""A Wedding in Jerusalem."" Another son, Itamar, who became secular, initiated the 2004 three-part series ""Looking Inside"" - a series in which Itamar examines the two worlds his father lived in, and they debate matters of faith, values and reconciliation between secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews. After several years Itamar returned to religious observance. The series was filmed in their Jerusalem home, as well as locations where Zohar lived and worked in Tel Aviv. Another son, Betzalel, managed the Migdal Or institutions of Rabbi Yitzhak David Grossman. The youngest son, David, is a Jerusalem city council member representing the United Torah Judaism party. Zohar's only daughter, Ahinoam, is the subject of the song ""Ahinoam Doesn't Know,"" which appeared on Erik Einstein's album ""Pozy.""
Rabbi Uri Zohar passed away on June 2, 2022 at the age of 86, after suffering a heart attack at his home in Jerusalem's Romema neighborhood. The funeral procession left from the home he lived in, accompanied by many mourners. He was buried in Har HaMenuchot cemetery on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.

27,"Meir Simcha of Dvinsk (1843–1926) was a rabbi and prominent leader of Orthodox Judaism in Eastern Europe in the early 20th century. He was a kohen, and is therefore often referred to as Meir Simcha ha-Kohen (""Meir Simcha the Kohen""). He is known for his writings on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, which he titled Ohr Somayach, as well as his novellae on the Torah, titled Meshech Chochma.


== Biography ==
Meir Simcha was born in Butrimonys (Yiddish: Baltrimantz), Lithuania, to Samson Kalonymus, a local wealthy merchant. According to family tradition, his later success in Torah study was attributed to two blessings his parents had received from local rabbis before his birth.
He received his education locally, and managed to evade the regular roundups of Jewish boys that were being held as a result of the Cantonist decrees that had been in effect since 1827.
After marrying in 1860, at age 17, he settled in Białystok, Poland, where he was supported by his wife, who opened a business to support him while he continued his Talmudic studies. After 27 years there he finally, after turning down many offers, accepted the rabbinate of the mitnagdim (non-Hasidic Jews) in the Latvian town of Dvinsk, now known as Daugavpils. He served in that position for 39 years until his death.
In Dvinsk, his counterpart was the Hasidic Rabbi Yosef Rosen, known as the Rogatchover Gaon or by his work Tzofnath Paneach. The two had a great respect for each other, despite Rosen's legendary fiery temper, and on occasions referred questions in Jewish law to each other. They also shared a love for the works of Maimonides.
In 1906, a certain Shlomo Friedlander claimed to have discovered and then published two tractates of the Jerusalem Talmud that had been considered to have been lost for hundreds of years. Rabbi Meir Simcha (as well as the Rogatchover Gaon, the Gerer Rebbe, Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Glasner of Klausenburg, the Dor Revi'i, and Rabbi Dr Yissachar Dov Ritter of Rotterdam) was one of the prominent rabbis who discovered that the work was a very clever forgery, and denounced it as such.
In Dvinsk, he received visitors from the whole region, and was frequently consulted on issues affecting the community at large, including Poland and Lithuania. He reputedly turned down offers for the rabbinate in various large cities, including Jerusalem, New York City and Kovno.
He died in a hotel in Riga while seeking medical treatment.


== Family ==
Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk had one unmarried daughter with mental issues who predeceased him. He therefore has no living descendants. However, some say that his daughter actually married the great Rav Avrohom Luftvir. Both his son in law and daughter died young and are buried in Warsaw.
As a result of this, one of his most prominent students and a close friend, Rabbi Yisrael Avraham Abba Krieger, committed to carrying on his legacy.

Meshech Chochma on Chumash.
Various treatises on parts of the Jerusalem Talmud.
Comments and insights on the Sefer haChinuch.


== Ideas and influence ==
He opposed the non-religious Zionist groups, but was in favor of Religious Zionists. After the Balfour Declaration, he was of the opinion that the Three Oaths were no longer in effect. He was present at the founding meetings of Agudath Yisrael in the German town of Bad Homburg, but could not attend the first large conference in Katowice due to poor health. He had several clashes with some of his contemporaries, including Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chafetz Chaim) on political issues and questions of Jewish law.
It is harder to determine his exact stance in philosophical matters, although much can be gleaned from his Meshech Chochma (see below).


== Bibliography ==
Rabbi Meir Simcha authored Ohr Somayach (or Ohr Sameiach) (""The delighted, or happy, light"", a play on his name, possibly derived from Proverbs 13:9), a collection of novellae on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. His approach is highly original, gathering material from the breadth of Jewish religious literature to approach difficult contradictions in Maimonides' main work of Jewish law. It was published during his lifetime and immediately became popular.
Other works, novellae on the Talmud and responsa, did not have the same impact but are still used for reference.
His main contribution to Jewish philosophy was to be posthumous. His pupil Menachem Mendel Zaks published Meshech Chochma (""The Price of Wisdom"", Meshech is the acronym of Meir Simcha Kohen, and the words derive from Job 28:18), which contains novellae on the Torah, but very often branches off into questions of Jewish philosophy. He is often quoted as having predicted the Holocaust in a statement in this work: ""They think that Berlin is Jerusalem...from there will come the storm winds that will uproot them"".


== Ohr Somayach yeshivas ==
In the late 1970s several baal teshuva yeshivas under Haredi Judaism auspices were founded and chose to honor the memory of Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk by calling themselves by his pen name for his work ""Ohr Somayach"". The first was the yeshiva Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem in Israel, and another was Ohr Somayach, Monsey in the United States. Other branches were established in Toronto and Montreal in Canada, and in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. Worldwide, branches, all bearing the name Ohr Somayach, are Ohr Somayach, South Africa, London in the United Kingdom, Kiev in the Ukraine, and Sydney in Australia.

28,"Rabbi Menachem Froman (also spelled Menahem and Fruman; Hebrew: מנחם פרומן‎; 1 June 1945 – 4 March 2013) was an Israeli Orthodox rabbi, and a peacemaker and negotiator with close ties to Palestinian religious leaders. A founding member of Gush Emunim, he served as the chief rabbi of Tekoa in the West Bank. He was well known for promoting and leading interfaith dialogue between Jews, Christians and Muslims, focusing on using religion as a tool and source for recognizing the humanity and dignity of all people. Together with a Palestinian journalist close to Hamas, Rabbi Froman drafted a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, known as the Froman-Amayreh Agreement. The agreement was endorsed by Hamas government, but it did not receive any official response from the Israeli government.


== Career ==
Froman, a former Israeli paratrooper who took part in the 1967 capture of the Western Wall, was a student at the Mercaz haRav and Yeshivat HaKotel yeshivas. He was among the founders of the Gush Emunim settlement movement, and supported the establishment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He obtained rabbinical ordination from Rabbis Shlomo Goren and Avraham Shapira, and then became the rabbi of Migdal Oz, a settlement in the Gush Etzion area. He was Chief Rabbi of the Knesset. He taught at several yeshivas, including Ateret Cohanim and Machon Meir, and was a lecturer at the Tekoa Yeshiva and Otniel hesder Yeshiva.


== Views and ideologies ==


=== Interfaith meetings and dialogue ===
Froman was involved in interfaith dialogue with Palestinians and Muslims, and participated in informal negotiations with many Palestinian leaders as he argued that peacemaking efforts between Israelis and Palestinians must include the religious sectors of both societies. Froman conducted meetings with controversial Palestinian leaders, including with the late PLO Chairman and President of Palestinian National Authority Yasser Arafat, and the Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and Mahmoud Al-Zahar. Froman had close ties with Palestinian leaders, as evidenced by a letter he sent to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas about his last conversation with Yasser Arafat:

I remember my last conversation with him, close to his death, when he answered me with emotion: ""You are my brother!"" and of course it is possible to explain his emotion, that he wanted to tell me, close to his death, that the two nations – the Israelis and the Palestinians – are brothers, that if the fate of one improves so does the fate of its double. The president customarily would thank me for these blessings and would order that these blessings be publicized in the Palestinian newspapers so that the Palestinian nation will know that there are Jewish rabbis who are blessing them with blessings of peace.
After the election of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, Froman stepped up his efforts to organize meetings between Israeli and Palestinian religious leaders. He met and conducted negotiations with current Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar and Hamas's Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, Sheikh Mahmoud Abu Tir, with the goal of drafting a ceasefire agreement that will end the killings in Gaza and the West Bank and lift the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip.


=== Froman–Amayreh Agreement (2008) ===
In February 2008, Froman reached a proposed agreement with Khaled Amayreh, a journalist close to Hamas, for an Israeli-Hamas ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that would put an immediate end to all Palestinian attacks against Israeli civilians or soldiers, facilitate the release of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and end the Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip. Senior Hamas officials have endorsed the agreement proposal. The Israeli government, however, did not respond to this initiative, effectively rejecting it.
Froman drafted the agreement proposal with Amayreh after meeting with him over the course of several months. The paper was finalized and shown to Hamas leaders in Gaza, and Hamas leader-in-exile Khaled Meshal, who approved of it. The proposal was also submitted to the Israeli government but according to Froman, the Israeli government never responded to it. The efforts of Froman and Amayreh to meet with Israeli government officials were rebuffed.
The proposal called for Israel to lift economic sanctions imposed on the Gaza Strip and open all border crossings. The cease-fire agreement included the release of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and a gradual release of Palestinian prisoners. The Israel Defense Forces would have ended ""all hostile activities toward the Gaza Strip, including targeted killings, the setting of ambushes, aerial bombardments and all penetrations into Gazan territory, in addition to ending the arrest, detention and persecution of Palestinians in the Strip.""
The Palestinians would have been obligated ""to take all the necessary steps to completely end the attacks against Israel"", including stopping ""indefinitely all rocket attacks on Israel"", assaults ""on Israeli civilians and soldiers"" and ""to impose a cease-fire on all groups, factions, and individuals operating in the Strip.""
Along with Amayreh, Froman said that even if the attempt turned out to be a mere academic exercise, its elements could be used by the Jerusalem and Gaza governments. It did not, for example, include the recognition by Hamas of the State of Israel, instead ""recognizing that there are Jews living in the Holy Land"", according to Froman, thus overcoming an obstacle that has long been a deal-breaker.


=== Importance of religion in the peace process ===
Froman lamented the early 21st century violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories, and laid partial blame for the failure of the Oslo Accords on the tendency of Israeli and Palestinian secular negotiators to ignore and marginalize religion and religious leaders in the peace process:

Ahmad Yassin told me about the Oslo Accords that they were an agreement between our heretics and your heretics to subdue religion. The Oslo Accords collapsed because the PLO could not control the other forces. Hamas has the power to enforce agreements to end violence. Even Arafat could not control and enforce agreements on murderous units in his organization and in Hamas. But if Hamas has a strong enough interest for a ceasefire, they can enforce it. It's not easy, because in the Palestinian society there are many groups and resistance committees, and also plain underworld figures. But if there will be a coalition with the PLO and Hamas to achieve a ceasefire, the chances of ending the shooting of Qassam rockets on Sderot are much better. Our primary goal should be achieving a ceasefire, and to reach that goal the politicians need to negotiate with politicians, and the rabbis negotiate with the religious leaders.


=== Jerusalem – a shared capital ===
Froman supported making Jerusalem (the capital of Israel, also claimed by the Palestinians as their capital) the religious capital of all three monotheistic faiths. In November 1999, he participated in a conference with dozens of international religious leaders, including the Dalai Lama. In his 2005 letter to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Froman cited examples from Jewish tradition of the importance of sharing Jerusalem between all 3 religions and turning it into a city of peace:

From the difficult experience of the shared history of the two nations – the Israel nation and the Palestinian nation – we can learn one important thing – between two brothers – when one's fate is bad, the fate is also bad of the second. Only when it is good for one, it will be, with God's help, good for its double. Little Jewish children know the famous story (the hadith) of the man who came to the head of the Jewish Sages and asked him to teach him the principle of the Jewish religion while he was standing on one foot (in one sentence). The Sage taught him, ""Love your neighbor exactly how you would love yourself...From this hadith, which summarized the main principle of our religion, it's possible to learn that just as Jews have obtained a free and thriving state from Allah the Exalted, respected in the world, and just as we obtained from Allah the Exalted a state with Jerusalem as its capital, our neighbor will also obtain a state with its capital as Jerusalem. If both nations will be fortunate to stone the Cursed Satan who stimulates war and hate, and establish Jerusalem as a capital of peace of Israel and Palestine, there will be, God willing, Jerusalem the Capital of Peace for the whole world!


=== Coexistence under Palestinian sovereignty ===
Froman opposed the forced eviction of Jewish settlers from their homes in the settlements in the West Bank, and advocated that the State of Israel withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, yet leave the settlements and Israeli/Jewish residents in place under Palestinian sovereignty. He claimed that, if Israel withdraws from Tekoa and most residents leave, he will nonetheless stay because of his love of the Land of Israel:

""But what matters is the holiness of this land. I prefer to live here in a future Palestine than leave to live in an Israeli state.""
He was a strong opponent of Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza. In August 2005, prior to the implementation of the disengagement plan, he moved with his family to Ganei Tal in Gush Katif in order to show support for the residents being evicted.
Froman supported the Palestinian Authority's efforts to attain statehood recognition at the United Nations on 20 September 2011, and said that the establishment of the Palestinian state will benefit the peace process and Israel.


== Personal life ==
Froman was born in 1945 in Galilee, Mandate Palestine. He was married to educator and artist Hadassah Froman, and the couple had 10 children.
Upon being diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2010, Froman declared that he would add ""Hai Shalom"" (living peace) to his last name and re-dedicate his life to peace and coexistence between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Despite treatment by both conventional and natural means, he died on the evening of 4 March 2013, at the age of 67. His funeral in Tekoa on 5 March 2013, lasting 4 hours, was filled with music and poetry, and was attended by thousands of people of all political and religious ideologies.

29,"Manoel Dias Soeiro (Dutch pronunciation: [maːˈnul ˈdijɑ(s) ˈsʋeːroː]); (1604 – 20 November 1657), better known by his Hebrew name Menasseh ben Israel (מנשה בן ישראל‎) or Menashe ben Israel, also known as Menasheh ben Yossef ben Yisrael, also known with the Hebrew acronym, MB""Y or MBI, was a Jewish scholar, rabbi, kabbalist, writer, diplomat, printer, publisher, and founder of the first Hebrew printing press (named Emeth Meerets Titsma`h) in Amsterdam in 1626.


== Life ==

Menasseh was born in La Rochelle in 1604, with the name Manoel Dias Soeiro, a year after his parents had left mainland Portugal because of the Inquisition. The family moved to the Netherlands in 1610. The Netherlands was in the middle of a process of religious revolt against Catholic Spanish rule throughout the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648). Amsterdam was an important center of Jewish life in Europe at this time. The family's arrival in 1610 was during the Twelve Years' Truce mediated by France and England at The Hague. In Amsterdam he studied under Moses Raphael de Aguilar.
Menasseh rose to eminence not only as a rabbi and an author, but also as a printer. He established the first Hebrew press in Holland. One of his earliest works, El Conciliador, published in 1632, won immediate reputation; it was an attempt to reconcile apparent discrepancies in various parts of the Hebrew Bible. Among his correspondents were Gerardus Vossius, Hugo Grotius, Petrus Serrarius, António Vieira and Pierre Daniel Huet. In 1638, he decided to settle in Brazil, as he still found it difficult to provide for his wife and family in Amsterdam. He may have visited the Dutch colony's capital of Recife, but did not move there. One of the reasons his financial situation improved in Amsterdam was the arrival of two Portuguese Jewish entrepreneurs, the brothers Abraham and Isaac Pereyra. They hired Rabbi Manasseh to direct a small college or academy (a yeshibah in Spanish-Portuguese parlance of the time) they had founded in the city.
In 1644, Menasseh met Antonio de Montezinos, a Portuguese traveler and Marrano Sephardic Jew who had been in the New World. Montezinos convinced him of his conclusion that the South America Andes' Indians were the descendants of the lost ten tribes of Israel. This purported discovery gave a new impulse to Menasseh's Messianic hopes, as the settlement of Jews throughout the world was supposed to be a sign that the Messiah would come. Filled with this idea, he turned his attention to England, whence the Jews had been expelled since 1290. He worked to get them permission to settle there again and thus hasten the Messiah's coming.
With the start of the Commonwealth, the question of the readmission of the Jews had found increased Puritan support, but it was often mooted under the growing desire for religious liberty. In addition, Messianic and other mystic hopes were then current in England. His book, The Hope of Israel, was first published in Amsterdam in Latin (Spes Israelis) and in Spanish (Esperança de Israel) in 1650. The book was written in response to a 1648 letter from John Dury enquiring about Montezinos' claims. In addition to reporting Montezinos' accounts of Jews in the Americas, the book also expressed the hope that the Jews would return to England as a way of hastening the coming of the messiah. Menasseh also stresses his kinship with parliament, and explains himself as driven by amity for England rather than financial gain.
In 1651 he offered to serve Christina, Queen of Sweden as her agent of Hebrew books. The same year he met Oliver St John and his envoys on his mission to secure an Anglo-Dutch coalition (which would have given Dutch citizens, and thus Jews, privileges to stay and work in England). The English were impressed by learning and manner, and advised him to formally apply for Jewish readmission to England. In 1652 The Hope of Israel was translated from Latin into English by John Dury or one of his associates, and it was published in London by Moses Wall, prefixed with a dedication to the Parliament and the Council of State; his account of descendants of the Lost Tribes being found in the New World deeply impressed public opinion and stirred up many polemics in English literature. This included a debate between Edward Spencer and Moses Wall, an MP and a scholar respectively, on ben Israel's millennial claims and the manner in which the Jews would be converted. Wall and Spencer's letters were printed in later additions of the book. Despite their historic misfortunes and movements, Menasseh characterizes the condition of Jewry at the time by saying:

Hence it may be seen that God hath not left us; for if one persecutes us, another receives us civilly and courteously; and if this prince treats us ill, another treats us well; if one banisheth us out of his country, another invites us with a thousand privileges; as divers princes of Italy have done, the most eminent King of Denmark, and the mighty Duke of Savoy in Nissa. And do we not see that those Republiques do flourish and much increase in trade who admit the Israelites?
Oliver Cromwell was sympathetic to the Jewish cause, partly because of his tolerant leanings but chiefly because he foresaw the importance for English commerce of the participation of the Jewish merchant princes, some of whom had already made their way to London. At this juncture, the English gave Jews full rights in the colony of Surinam, which they had controlled since 1650. There is some debate among historians concerning whether Menasseh's motives for pursuing the readmission of the Jews by England were primarily political or religious. Ismar Schorsch, for example, has argued that the idea of England being a final place for Jews to inhabit in order to bring about the coming of the Messiah was hardly present in The Hope of Israel (1652), but rather was developed by Menasseh later (1656-57 when he was in London) in order to appeal to English Christians with Millenarian beliefs. Henry Méchoulan, on the other hand, in his later in-depth detailed analysis of the book has striven to show that the Jewish messianic theme in it is also rather fundamental to its initial conception. Steven Nadler, in his 2018 book, which is actually the last word on Menasseh's biography to be published to date, has seemingly also closed the debate on this issue of Menasseh's own messianic beliefs:

They [the sundry European Gentile Millenarians that were in contact with him] especially valued [Menasseh] as the Jewish expositor of a common [Jewish-Christian] Messianic vision, wherein the worldly empires will be swept away by a ""Fifth Kingdom"" [or Fifth Monarchy] ruled by a savior sent by God.
In November 1655, Menasseh arrived in London. During his absence from the Netherlands, the Amsterdam rabbis excommunicated his student, Baruch Spinoza. In London, Menasseh published his Humble Addresses to the Lord Protector, but its effect was weakened by William Prynne's publication of Short Demurrer. Cromwell summoned the Whitehall Conference in December of the same year.
Some of the most notable statesmen, lawyers, and theologians of the day were summoned to this conference to discuss whether the Jews should be readmitted to England. The chief practical result was the declaration of judges Glynne and Steele that ""there was no law which forbade the Jews' return to England"" (as they had been expelled by royal decree of King Edward I, and not by formal parliamentary action; Jews remaining in England lived, however, under constant threat of expulsion). Though nothing was done to regularize the position of the Jews, the door was opened to their gradual return. On 14 December 1655, John Evelyn entered in his Diary, ""Now were the Jews admitted."" When Prynne and others attacked the Jews, Menasseh wrote his major work, Vindiciae judaeorum (1656), in response.
Menasseh ben Israel stayed in England for close to two years after the Whitehall Conference. During this time he tried to obtain written permission for the resettlement of the Jews in England. Although he failed in this endeavour, during his stay he met with a large number of influential figures of the age, including Cambridge theologian Ralph Cudworth, Henry Oldenburg, Robert Boyle and his sister, Adam Boreel, John Sadler, John Dury and Samuel Hartlib, as well as more marginal prophetic figures such as Ambrose Barnes and Arise Evans. Ben Israel's stay was managed by the millenarian philosemite Baptist clergyman Henry Jessey.


== Death and burial ==

In February 1657 Cromwell granted ben Israel a state pension of £100, but he died before enjoying it, at Middelburg in the Netherlands in the winter of 1657 (14 Kislev 5418). He was conveying the body of his son Samuel home for burial.
His grave is in the Beth Haim of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel. and remains intact (headstone and gravestone).


== Writings ==

Menasseh ben Israel was the author of many works. His major work Nishmat Hayim is a treatise in Hebrew on the Jewish concept of reincarnation of souls, published by his son Samuel six years before they both died. Some scholars think that he studied kabbalah with Abraham Cohen de Herrera, a disciple of Israel Saruk. This would explain his familiarity with the method of Isaac Luria.
The Conciliator was, as above, a work written to reconcile the apparent contradictions in numerous passages throughout the Bible. To achieve this aim, Ben Israel ""utilized an astounding range of sources""; primarily the Talmud and the classic Jewish commentaries but frequently quotes from the early Christian authorities as well as Greek and Latin authors of antiquity. Written in Spanish, in Amsterdam, 1632,  it was aimed primarily to strengthen the faith of the Marranos in the veracity of the Tanach according to Jewish interpretation.  It was translated by Elias Haim Lindo and published by Duncan and Malcolm, in 1842, and again in 1972, with footnotes and introductory material by Sepher-Hermon Press.
His other works include:

== Descendants ==
Menasseh's wife, Rachel, was a descendant of the Abarbanel family. Menasseh had three children by her.  According to family legend, the Abarbanels were descendants of King David, and he was proud of his children's Davidic ancestry.  Both of Menasseh's sons predeceased their father.  Menasseh's eldest son was Samuel Abarbanel Soeiro, also known as Samuel Ben Israel, who worked as a printer and assisted his father with matters in England.  He died in 1657.  Menasseh's youngest son, Joseph, died at age 20, in 1650, on a disastrous business trip to Poland.   Menasseh also had a daughter, Gracia, born 1628, who married Samuel Abarbanel Barboza in 1646, and died in 1690.
Moses Jacob Ezekiel, the American sculptor, in his autobiography claimed to be a descendant of Menasseh Ben Israel. His claim is unconfirmed.

30,"Rabbi Mendel Hess (March 17, 1807, Lengsfeld (now Stadtlengsfeld), Saxe-Weimar - September 21, 1871, Eisenach) was a German rabbi.


== Biography ==
He was one of the first Jewish theologians to combine a university education with Talmudical training. From 1828 until his death he was chief rabbi of the grand duchy of Weimar, residing first at Lengsfeld and later at Eisenach. Although the measure had aroused great dissatisfaction among the Jews, he strictly enforced the decree of the government (June 20, 1823) ordaining that Jewish services should be conducted exclusively in the German language and that the reading in Hebrew of sections of the Bible should be followed by their translation into the vernacular.
The position of rabbi as government official became very unpleasant, as he was required to inform against those who failed to attend the services, a requirement which even the progressive Jews, who approved of the ordinance, condemned. Intermarriages between Jews and Christians being allowed in the grand duchy, Hess officially consecrated such nuptials, notwithstanding the proviso that the offspring should be brought up in the Christian faith. In the consecration of Jewish marriages he likewise ignored time-honored traditional rabbinical regulations, and it is said that in his disregard of Jewish sentiment he went so far as to attend a theater on the eve of the Day of Atonement (Allg. Zeit. des Jud., 1845, p. 62).
Hess was a member of the three rabbinical conferences which (1844–46) convened at Brunswick, Frankfort-on-the-Main, and Breslau, and as such was an advocate of uncompromising radicalism. After 1848 he felt the illiberality of enforced reforms, and petitioned the government to repeal the law which made attendance at the Reform services compulsory (Allg. Zeit. des Jud. 1853, p. 474).
He edited Der Israelit des Neunzehnten Jahrhunderts from 1839 to 1847, and, with Samuel Holdheim as co-editor, in 1847 and 1848. Hess also published two collections of sermons and addresses (Eisenach, 1839, 1843).

31,"Sabato Morais (Hebrew: שבתאי מוראיס; April 13, 1823 – November 11, 1897) was an Italian-American rabbi of Portuguese descent, leader of Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia, pioneer of Italian Jewish Studies in America, and founder of the Jewish Theological Seminary, which initially acted as a center of education for Orthodox Rabbis.


== Early years ==
Morais was born in Livorno, Italy. He was the elder son and the third of nine children of Samuel and Bona Morais. The Morais family came originally from Portugal, being probably among the large number of Jews who fled thence from the Inquisition. At the time of Sabato's birth, Italy was in the thick of her great struggle for freedom. Samuel Morais was an ardent republican, at one time undergoing imprisonment for his political views, and his father, Sabato Morais, was prominently identified with the political movements of his day.
Upon young Sabato early rested the responsibility of aiding in the support of the family. While still a child he earned a little by teaching Hebrew hymns and prayers to other children, meantime pursuing his own studies under Rabbis Funaro, Curiat, and others, and then under his Hebrew master, Rabbi Abraham Baruch Piperno, and gaining honorable mention in belles-lettres under Prof. Salvatore de Benedetti. In addition to Hebrew and Italian, he acquired familiarity with Aramaic, French, and Spanish.
He remained at his home studying and teaching until 1845, when he went to London to apply for the vacant post of assistant hazzan of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation in that city. (The position of ""hazzan"", literally ""cantor"", in the context of 19th-century American Judaism was generally equivalent to the contemporary position of ""rabbi""). Owing to his unfamiliarity with English he was unsuccessful and returned to his home, but in the following year (1846) he accepted an invitation to become Hebrew master of the Orphans' School of the same congregation. Here he remained five years, meantime perfecting himself in English. During this period he formed a close friendship with Joseph Mazzini, and that patriot's struggle for Italian freedom was warmly seconded by Morais.


== Elected hazzan in Philadelphia ==
In 1850, owing to the withdrawal of Isaac Leeser, the pulpit of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue congregation at Philadelphia, became vacant, and Morais was an applicant for the post. He arrived in Philadelphia on March 17, 1851, and was elected April 13 following, the synagogue services in the interval being conducted by him. In 1855 he married Clara Esther Weil, who died in 1872, leaving seven children. From the date of his installation as hazzan until his death his influence was a continually growing power for traditional (Orthodox) Judaism. The synagogue formerly (c.1906) occupied by the Mikveh Israel congregation was built and consecrated during his incumbency.
Though his ministry covered the period of greatest activity in the adaptation of Judaism in America to changed conditions, he, as the advocate of Orthodox Judaism, withstood every appeal in behalf of ritualistic innovations and departures from traditional practice, winning the esteem of his opponents by his consistency and integrity. His sermons covered a wide scope of thought and action, and he showed the loftiness of his spirit when, in spite of congregational opposition to the expression of his views during the American Civil War, he continued, both in prayer and in his discourses, to show his warm sympathy with the cause of the slave. In appreciation of his attitude during these trying times the Union League Club of Philadelphia placed him on the roll of its honorary members.


== Aids in founding the Theological Seminary ==
When, in 1867, Maimonides College was established in Philadelphia, Morais was made professor of the Bible and of Biblical literature, and he held the chair during the six years that the college existed. For a number of years thereafter he felt the urgent need of an institution for the training of Jewish ministers on historical and traditional lines, and the declarations of the Pittsburg Conference in 1885 urged him to immediate action. After a considerable agitation of the subject he succeeded, in conjunction with a few others, in establishing (January, 1886) the Jewish Theological Seminary at New York.
He was at once made president of the faculty and professor of Bible, holding both posts until his death. Unquestionably the establishment of the seminary constitutes Morais' most lasting influence upon Judaism in America. The directors of that body have fittingly recognized his memory by naming the chair of Biblical literature and exegesis ""the Sabato Morais professorship."" In 1887 the University of Pennsylvania conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, he being the first Jew so honored by that institution. Many of his papers are evidently held in that institution's library.


== His multifarious activity ==
In addition to the work which he did in official positions, Morais was most active in religious, educational, and charity matters. The Hebrew Sunday-School Society, the Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia, and the Young Men's Hebrew Association of that city numbered him among their most steadfast friends. In his own home he gathered about him a small band of young men whom he instructed in Hebrew, Talmud, and Jewish history, and in whom he inspired a zealous love for Judaism which has had a very marked effect upon the character not only of his pupils (among them Isaac Husik), but of the community at large.  Among his children, Henry Samuel Morais was also a well-known communal rabbi, serving at several different congregations in Mikve Israel and other congregations in New York and Rhode Island.
The strong conservatism of the Jews of Philadelphia and the warm interest in the higher things of Judaism evinced by the younger men of that city may be in a large measure directly traced to the influence of Sabato Morais. He was greatly interested in the Alliance Israélite Universelle, and was in constant correspondence with rabbis and scholars in Europe and the Orient. Through his friend Chevalier Emanuel Felice Veneziani, the almoner of Baron de Hirsch, he was enabled to secure timely aid for the agricultural colonies in New Jersey and was the representative of Baron de Hirsch in the Carmel Colony.
When the Russo-Jewish exodus began, in 1882, and Russian Jews in large numbers settled in Philadelphia, Morais immediately became their friend. Although unable to speak their language, his perfect familiarity with Hebrew as a living tongue gave him a ready means of communication. Among Gentiles also he was widely known and esteemed, and was very frequently called upon to address public assemblies.
Besides his sermons, he contributed to Jewish literature much in the form of addresses to various Jewish organizations and of theological, polemical, literary, and critical articles for the Jewish press at home and abroad. He wrote classic Hebrew in prose and in verse with ease and elegance.
In all his life, Morais maintained close (cultural, religious and political) ties with his motherland, Italy. His translations and essays in Italian Jewry made him the founding father of Italian Jewish Studies in America.
Among his later works are:

A translation of the Prolegomena to a Grammar of the Hebrew Language, by S. D. Luzzatto (in Fifth Biennial Report of the Jewish Theological Seminary)
An Essay on the Jew in Italy (in Second Biennial Report of the same)
Italian Jewish Literature (in Publications of Gratz College, 1897)
His translation of the Book of Jeremiah for the Bible of the Jewish Publication Society of America was completed shortly before his death, which occurred in Philadelphia on November 11, 1897.
Morias is interred in the Mikveh Israel Cemetery (11th and Federal).

After her ordination she served first as assistant and then as associate rabbi at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York City, and later led Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls, New Jersey from 1981 until her retirement in 2006. She is featured in numerous books including Rabbis: The Many Faces of Judaism and Fifty Jewish Women who Changed the World.


== Early life and education ==
Sally Jane Priesand was born June 27, 1946, in Cleveland, Ohio into a Jewish family. Her parents, Irving Theodore, an engineer, and Rose Elizabeth (Welch) Priesand were not religiously observant but they were active in Jewish organizations. Her mother served as president of the sisterhood of their temple, while her father was president of a B'nai B'rith lodge. Her family lit Shabbat candles, celebrated Chanukah and had a Passover Seder to which the children were encouraged to invite a non-Jewish friend to share in the festivities and learn about Judaism. The family first attended a non-egalitarian Conservative synagogue, and later attended Beth Israel-West Temple, a Reform congregation on Cleveland's West Side, where Priesand began to display a commitment to Judaism and Jewish life as a teenager. Priesand did not become Bat Mitzvah but was confirmed and continued her religious school education through the twelfth grade. At the age of 16, she decided she wanted to be a rabbi. She later described her decision to become a rabbi as ""an affirmation of my belief in God, in the worth of each individual, and in Judaism as a way of life.""

While still in high school, she requested admission information from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati (HUC-JIR). In answer to her letter, the school responded: ""We are pleased to learn of your interest in our college. ... Since you state in your letter that your interests lean specifically to the rabbinate, we would have to inform you candidly that we do not know what opportunities exist for women in the active rabbinate, since we have, as yet, not ordained any women."" And another letter stated: ""... You might also ascertain from Rabbi Litt, and he in turn from other rabbis, just what would be the disposition of the rabbinate respecting someone like you who is interested in being ordained by the College-Institute. While we have had women students, none so far, has taken the full course of study which would lead to graduation and ordination as a rabbi. Therefore, some clear knowledge on your part of what it will mean to you to have graduated from our school is essential for you prior to your thinking about entering. The question of a woman as a rabbi is a question for the rabbis rather than for the school. There is no attempt on our part to discourage you but to direct your thinking. ... ""
Entering the University of Cincinnati in 1964, she was accepted into the joint program of HUC-JIR and the University of Cincinnati. She graduated with a Bachelor of Hebrew Letters and a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from HUC-JIR and the University of Cincinnati in 1968.


=== Rabbinic school ===
Upon her graduation, she was admitted to HUC-JIR's rabbinic school without undergoing a formal application process, being the only woman among 35 men. While still in rabbinical school, she received a great deal of attention from the media. In April 1971, she was the subject of an article in The New York Times, titled ""Her Ambition Is to Become a Rabbi – And a Housewife"", in which she stated: ""I'm not an active supporter of women's lib. ... I don't need it. But I do think the feminist movement is important because it is time for us to overcome psychological and emotional objections. We must fulfill our potential as creative individuals.""
Despite opposition – many said she was at HUC-JIR to marry a rabbi and become a rebbetzin rather than to officiate as a rabbi – she became the first woman at Hebrew Union College to make it to ordination, an accomplishment she credits to her parents and to Rabbi Nelson Glueck, the college's president who died a few months before her ordination.
Her thesis for her Master of Arts in Hebrew Letters degree, ""Historic and Changing Role of the Jewish Woman"", published in 1975 under the title Judaism and the New Woman, highlighted the changing role of women in Jewish history and was meant to advance their emancipation in Jewish religious life.
It was only many years later that she learned her ordination certificate from HUC had different wording for her title than the certificates of men graduating with her. ""It came as a shock to me,"" she noted. ""When I was ordained I was told I would be getting an empty tube because they had forgotten to change the language to the feminine"" on the ordination scroll. ""I just accepted that. When I finally got it I thought the title, which they had changed to 'rav u'morah,' was what all my classmates got, too."" In actuality, male candidates' certificates identified them by the Reform movement's traditional ""morenu harav,"" or ""our teacher the rabbi,"" while female candidates' certificates only used the term ""rav u'morah,"" or ""rabbi and teacher"", up until 2016. After four years of deliberation, HUC decided to give women a choice of wording beginning in 2016, including the option to have the same wording as men.


== Career ==


=== Ordination ===
Priesand was ordained on June 3, 1972, by Glueck's successor as HUC-JIR's president Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk at the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati, making her the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi in the United States and believed to be only the second woman ever to be formally ordained in the history of Judaism.
Gottschalk called the ordination of Priesand ""historic"", one that breaks stereotypes and allows ""Jewish women to consider seeking the rabbinate"" and a testament to Reform Judaism's efforts at achieving ""equality of women in the congregation of the Lord"". By acquiescing to women's ordination at a time of social and political changes in American life, the Reform movement portrayed itself as continuing its historic project of adapting Judaism to respond to modernity while simultaneously demonstrating its commitment to women's equality.
After her ordination, then member of Congress Bella Abzug arranged for her to deliver the opening prayer at the House of Representatives, making her the first Jewish woman to do so.


=== Rabbinical positions ===
Upon ordination, she was interviewed by some synagogues for her ""public value, so they could say they were first"", as she says, but others would not speak to her, and she was the last of her class to get a job. She was offered a position at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York City, where she served for seven years under Rabbi Edward Klein, first as Assistant Rabbi and then as Associate Rabbi, leaving the congregation in 1979, when she realised that she would not succeed Klein as senior rabbi. Not able to find a full-time position, she served as part-time rabbi of Temple Beth El in Elizabeth, New Jersey and as Chaplain at Manhattan's Lenox Hill Hospital until 1981, when she became rabbi of Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls, New Jersey. She originally thought her ""obligation was to get a bigger
congregation"", but rejected the traditional model which encourages rabbis to look for larger pulpits and remained at Monmouth Reform Temple, a congregation of 365 families, where she ""forged a creative partnership with ... her congregation, acting upon her belief that a rabbi's primary task is to help Jews take responsibility for their Judaism"".
In 1986 at Monmouth Reform Temple, she and cantor Ellen Sussman became the first all-women team of rabbi and cantor in any congregation. Also during her rabbinate, Monmouth Reform Temple created a Social Action Committee which launched a nationally recognized gun safety campaign (Please ASK, which was given an award in 2003 by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism), was a leader in the fight against drunk driving, created a permanent Fund for the Homeless to support the work of Interfaith Neighbors, sponsored an annual food drive for The Center in Asbury Park, continued to host an annual Monmouth County arts festival, and instituted an annual ""Mitzvah Day"" of charitable volunteerism.


=== Documentary appearance ===
Priesand appeared in a 2005 documentary, titled And the Gates Opened: Women in the Rabbinate, which features stories of and interviews with her, rabbi Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, and rabbi Amy Eilberg.


=== Health issues ===
In 1987, Priesand was diagnosed with breast cancer, which struck again eight years later, and in 2003, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She was able to continue working during her treatments for breast cancer, but the thyroid cancer treatments forced her to take a three-month leave of absence. Her illness affected her rabbinate, making her ""more sensitive and aware of the needs of others who were dealing with health crises"", she said.


=== Organizational affiliations ===
Priesand has served on the board of every major institution of Reform Judaism, including the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Union for Reform Judaism and the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. She is a member of Jewish Women International, Hadassah, the National Council of Jewish Women, the National Organization for Women and the National Breast Cancer Coalition. In her local community, she is an Honorary Vice President of the Jewish Federation of Greater Monmouth County and President of Interfaith Neighbors, an organization whose primary purpose is to provide rental assistance and support services for those who are homeless. She also chairs the Clergy Advisory Committee of Planned Parenthood of Central New Jersey and serves on the board of the Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights Education Center at Brookdale Community College, and the Jewish Heritage Museum of Monmouth County.


== Retirement and current life ==
Priesand retired from Monmouth Reform Temple on June 30, 2006, after 25 years of service to that congregation. She explained her retirement, saying: ""I'm retiring by choice, because I believe that rabbis should know when to leave and when it's time to inject 'newness' into synagogue life."" She intends to remain ""a part of the temple family"" as rabbi emerita, adding ""being here has been the fulfillment of my dream to be a congregational rabbi, which is why I went to rabbinic school in the first place.""
Upon her retirement, Monmouth Reform Temple set up the ""Sally Priesand Endowment Fund for the Future"" in her honor to preserve and protect the temple's legacy.
Priesand lives in Ocean Township, New Jersey, with her Boston Terrier, Shadow. She intends to establish a Monmouth County kollel, a center for adult Jewish study. Her hobbies include photography and abstract watercolor. She had her first solo exhibition in the Backman Gallery at HUC-JIR in New York in 2002, in honor of the thirtieth anniversary of her ordination, and exhibits annually in the Monmouth Festival of the Arts.
In 2007, she invited her female rabbinic colleagues of all denominations to join her in donating their professional and personal papers to the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati, Ohio, in order to document the history of women in the rabbinate. The first ever exhibit of the historical memorabilia of her career was displayed at the Jewish Heritage Museum of Monmouth County in the winter of 2010.
On December 6, 2010, at Temple Reyim in Newton, Massachusetts, Priesand and the other three first American ordained women rabbis of four denominations of American Judaism met for the first time in an event called ""First Lights"", videotaped by the Los Angeles-based Story Archive of Women Rabbis, a project which videotapes interviews with women rabbis from all streams of Judaism and archives their stories online. Priesand together with Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, the first Reconstructionist female rabbi ordained in 1974, Amy Eilberg, the first Conservative female rabbi ordained in 1985, and Sara Hurwitz (see below), lit Chanuka candles together with some 30 other women rabbis, and then spoke about their experiences.


=== 40th anniversary of ordination ===
Priesand was honored in several events on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of her ordination in 2012.
In March 2012, the Annual Convention of the Central Conference of American Rabbis celebrated the 40th anniversary of women's ordination by calling Priesand to the Torah at the Monday morning prayer service; through May 2012, the Union for Reform Judaism was running a blog to celebrate ""Forty Years of Women"" in honor of the anniversary; and Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion honored her as special guest at the June 2, 2012 ordination ceremony at Plum Street Temple, during which 13 candidates were ordained – eight of them women.
On the day of the anniversary on June 3, 2012, Priesand, Eisenberg Sasso, Eilberg, and Hurwitz met for a ""Four First Women Rabbis"" discussion at Monmouth Reform Temple for a celebration honoring the four first women rabbis ordained in North America in their respective denominations, and the 40th anniversary of Priesand's ordination.


==== After her 40th ordination anniversary ====
In 2014 Priesand was one of those who attended the ceremony when a memorial plaque to Regina Jonas, the first woman to be ordained as a rabbi, was unveiled at Theresienstadt in the Czech Republic, where Regina Jonas had been deported to and worked in for two years. There is a short documentary about the trip on which this plaque was unveiled, titled In the Footsteps of Regina Jonas, which includes Priesand.


=== 50th anniversary of ordination ===
Two exhibits on the  Cincinnati campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion marked the fiftieth anniversary of Priesand's ordination; Priesand herself was the keynote speaker at the opening reception for them. One of those exhibits was the art exhibit “Holy Sparks”, which featured 24 Jewish women artists, who had each created an artwork about a female rabbi who was a first in some way. Joan Roth created the artwork about Priesand. The other exhibit, called ""Sally Priesand Paves the Way"", featured ""documents relating to Rabbi Sally J. Priesand's journey to becoming the first woman rabbi ordained in North America"", and memorabilia and personal artifacts donated by Priesand.
The anniversary was also marked by a number of articles in various media outlets.


== Writings ==
Priesand is the author of Judaism and the New Woman, and a contributor to Women Rabbis: Exploration and Celebration, and to A Treasury of Favorite Sermons by Leading American Rabbis. She also wrote the foreword to the book The Sacred Calling: Four Decades of Women in the Rabbinate, published in 2016, which contains one piece called ""Letters from Hebrew Union College to Sally J. Priesand"" and another called ""The Ordination of Sally J. Priesand, A Historic Interview"".


== Awards and honors ==
In 1973, Priesand was awarded an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Florida International University.
In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; card number 6 featured Priesand's name and picture.
From 1981 to 1983, Bonnie Tiburzi put on three “Women of Accomplishment” luncheons for the Wings Club honoring certain women, including Priesand.
In 1997, Priesand received an honorary doctor of divinity degree from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR). In the same year, the Rabbi Sally J. Priesand Visiting Professorship in Jewish Women's Studies was established in her honor at HUC-JIR.
In 2006, upon her retirement, Monmouth Reform Temple dedicated its sanctuary doors in her honor; they are inscribed with the following words, ""פִּתְחוּ לִי שַׁעֲרֵי צֶדֶק אָבֹא בָם אוֹדֶה יָהּ Open the gates of righteousness for me that I may enter and praise God.""
Also in 2006 upon her retirement, Monmouth Reform Temple set up the ""Sally Priesand Endowment Fund for the Future"" in her honor to preserve and protect the temple's legacy.
On April 23, 2009, she received the prestigious Elizabeth Blackwell Award given by Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York to women whose lives exemplify outstanding service to humanity. The award is named after Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell (1821–1910), the first woman in America to receive the Doctor of Medicine degree.
In 2010, in honor of its 125th anniversary, Good Housekeeping magazine named her one of ""125 women who changed our world"".
The Rabbi Sally J. Priesand WRJ Award was created to honor the 45th anniversary of Priesand's ordination. The award is given out once every year to a graduating Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Cincinnati campus woman, chosen because she ""exemplif[ies] the mission and values of WRJ and embod[ies] the qualities that Rabbi Priesand has exhibited throughout her career, including her clarity of vision, her commitment to excellence, her professionalism, her dedication to the continuity of Reform Judaism, her passion, and her perseverance.

34,"Fred J. Neulander (August 14, 1941 – April 17, 2024) was an American Reform rabbi from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who was convicted of hiring two men to murder his wife, Carol Neulander, in 1994. He died while serving a prison term of 30 years to life at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jersey.


== Biography ==
Neulander was the founding rabbi of the Congregation M'Kor Shalom Reform Temple in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. It opened in the summer of 1974. Previously, he had been the assistant rabbi at Temple Emanuel, also in Cherry Hill. Neulander graduated from Trinity College in 1963.
In 2002, Neulander was convicted of paying congregant Len Jenoff and drifter Paul Daniels $30,000 (in some sources, $18,000) for the November 1, 1994 murder of his wife, Carol. The case became a media circus and was broadcast live on CourtTV. In February 1995, he resigned as Rabbi from Congregation M'Kor Shalom.
At the time of his wife's murder, Neulander had been involved in a two-year affair with Philadelphia radio personality Elaine Soncini. The affair began after he visited Soncini's Jewish husband, Ken Garland, in the hospital and later officiated at Garland's funeral. Soncini, who was Catholic, converted to Judaism and joined M'Kor Shalom as a member during their affair.
Neulander died on April 17, 2024, at the age of 82.


== Trials ==
Tried before Judge Linda G. Baxter in 2001, the first trial resulted in a hung jury. It had been empaneled in Camden County, New Jersey.
Due to the intense media coverage in Camden County, the re-trial was moved to Monmouth County. At the 2002 re-trial, Neulander was defended by Mt. Holly attorney Mike Riley.  In Monmouth, Neulander was found guilty. His son Matthew, whose testimony at the first trial had been lukewarm, was by the time of the second trial thoroughly convinced of his father's guilt. Following the verdict, Assistant Prosecutor Jim Lynch submitted to the jury the question of whether or not the death penalty should be sought. The jury panel decided not to recommend the death penalty. Neulander was sentenced to serve 30 years to life at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. In an interview by ABC's Barbara Walters after his incarceration, he told her ""You have no idea how much rage I have."" He was also saddened that two of his three adult children testified against him.


== Appeal ==
In December 2006, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division affirmed Fred Neulander's conviction on appeal.  
His appellate counsel had argued that the trial court had erred in not permitting Neulander to argue a third party liability defense based on a similar home invasion burglary murder that had occurred in Cherry Hill. Neulander had also argued court error on the issue of double or triple layer ""hearsay"" evidence, i.e., the out-of-court statement by Carol Neulander as elicited by and through her daughter, about the telephone conversation involving the ""bathroom man"". Although an appeal and post-conviction relief application were planned, Neulander's best chance at a new trial had been lost. He was incarcerated in the New Jersey State Prison at the time of his death.

35,"Gershom Sizomu (born 1969) is a Ugandan rabbi serving the Abayudaya, a Baganda community in eastern Uganda near the town of Mbale who practice Judaism. Sizomu is the first native-born black rabbi in Sub-Saharan Africa. He is also the first Chief Rabbi of Uganda. Sizomu is a member of the Ugandan Parliament.


== Childhood ==
Sizomu was born into an Abayudaya  family, and his grandfather was the community's leader. The Abayudaya were persecuted during the years of the Idi Amin regime, when it was illegal to openly practice the Jewish faith in Uganda. During his childhood, Sizomu's father was arrested for building a sukkah as part of the celebration of the Jewish holiday Sukkot. His father was released when Sizomu's family paid the arresting officer with a ransom of five goats. In 1979, following the overthrow of the Amin government, freedom of religion was restored in Uganda, and Sizomu's family celebrated by hosting 200 people in a Passover Seder consisting of homemade matzoh and macco, a Ugandan banana wine with an 80 per cent alcohol content.


== Education ==
The Abayudaya was not recognized by the government of Israel as being Jewish because the community had not formally converted to Judaism. In 2003, Sizomu sought Israeli approval of the Abayudaya by inviting four U.S. rabbis to conduct a conversion ceremony for 300 Abayudaya Jews, which they did in 2003, in a ceremony consisting of the question, 'Why do you want to be Jewish?', to which the Abayudaya responded: ""I was born Jewish and I'd like to stay Jewish."" Others refused to take part saying: ""We're already Jewish."" Sizomu has openly identified himself as a Zionist and once stated in an interview: ""If the Arab world declared war on Israel, we would fight and die to protect it.""
Sizomu earned a Bachelor of Arts in education from Islamic University in Uganda. As a Be'chol Lashon Rabbinic Fellow at the Institute for Jewish & Community Research, he came to the U.S. to 2003 to study in a five-year graduate program at the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles. He graduated in 2008 and was ordained as a rabbi under the auspices of Conservative Judaism.


== Rabbinical activities ==
In July 2008, Sizomu returned to Uganda and conducted a conversion ceremony for 250 people at the village of Nabogoya, with converts coming from across Uganda and from Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. During the ceremony, Sizomu stressed the viability of the Jewish faith for sub-Saharan Africans by noting, ""The relationship between God and the Jews in the Torah resonates for many spiritual seekers. It is important that Africans and others know that they can choose Judaism as a spiritual path and that we are open to them.""


== Political activities ==
Rabbi Sizomu was a candidate to represent Uganda's Bungokho North District in Parliament in the 2011 election, held on February 18, 2011. He lost that election, but ran again in 2016 and was elected to Parliament in a close race.

36,"Mitchell Salem Fisher (1903/1904 – March 19, 1990) was an American rabbi who resigned from his active rabbinic position in 1930 because of what he described as ""institutional restraint"" and a separation between preachers and issues in the world. After his resignation, Fisher became a lawyer with a specialization in marriage law. He worked for the Anti-Nazi League in opposition to the German American Bund, served as counsel to the New York Board of Rabbis, and played a significant role in the development of family law in New York.


== Early life and education ==
Mitchell Salem Fisher was born in 1903 or 1904. He graduated with a B.A. from New York University in 1923, and received an M.A. from Columbia University in 1927, as well as a PhD in 1930. He additionally attended the Jewish Institute of Religion, from which he received the John Palmer Prize in 1926 and was ordained as a rabbi in 1927.


== Career ==


=== As a rabbi ===

From 1925 to 1928, Fisher was rabbi of Temple Israel. In 1928 he became acting rabbi at Rodeph Shalom, and in 1930 supervised the congregation's move into a new synagogue building.
As a rabbi, Fisher described Prohibition as a ""national curse"". He supported the Socialist Party of America and its presidential candidate Norman Thomas. He was additionally a Zionist, and served as the first national vice president of Zionist student organization Avukah.
In April 1930, one month after the 1930 move, Fisher resigned, citing a desire to speak strongly about issues ""without immediate institutional restraint"". In his letter of resignation, he criticized the position of rabbi as ""an exalted lecturer, entertainer and institution promotion agent"". While stating that he expected other rabbis to ""boldly assert upon learning of this letter that they are free"", Fisher asserted that ""with very, very few exceptions none of them is the possessor of effective freedom. And those few who have won their fight to such freedom usually have done so outside of the conventional paths of rabbinical success.""
In response to Fisher's resignation, The American Hebrew described his disillusionment as discouraging and stated that ""If the modern synagogue shackles a Rabbi’s idealism so that the ideals he preaches become patently and utterly vain our lay leaders ought to know it and ascertain the reasons why.""


=== As a lawyer ===
After his resignation, Fisher attended Columbia Law School, graduating in 1933 and becoming a lawyer. He began working for the Anti-Nazi League, which opposed the German American Bund, promoted a boycott of German goods in the years prior to World War II, and later successfully infiltrated and exposed the Ku Klux Klan. He additionally served as counsel to the New York Board of Rabbis. Specializing in marriage law, Fisher helped to draft much of the family law for New York.


== Publications ==
In 1973, Reconstructionist Press published a book by Fisher titled Rebel, O Jews! And Other Prayers. One poem from the book, titled ""Prayer for a Disturbed Sabbath"", was adapted and used in the Mishkan T'filah.


== Later life and death ==
Fisher died on March 19, 1990, at the Home for the Jewish Aging in Ewing, New Jersey. He was 86 years old when he died, with three living children, eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

38,"Moritz Güdemann (Hebrew: משה גידמן; 19 February 1835 – 5 August 1918) was an Austrian rabbi and historian. He served as chief rabbi of Vienna.


== Biography ==
Moritz (Moshe) Güdemann attended the Jewish school in Hildesheim, and thereafter went to a Catholic Gymnasium. He was educated at the University of Breslau (Ph.D. 1858), and took his rabbinical diploma (1862) at the newly founded Jewish Theological Seminary there. In the latter year he was called to the rabbinate of Magdeburg; in 1866 he went to Vienna as preacher, where he became rabbi in 1868, and chief rabbi in 1892.
He married his first wife, Fanny Spiegel, in 1863. After her death he married Ida Sachs, with whom he had four children.


== On Zionism ==
Güdemann protested the proposal to strike from the prayer-book all passages referring to the return of the Jews to the Holy Land (compare his sermon ""Jerusalem, die Opfer und die Orgel,"" 1871). He threatened to resign over this issue. There are conflicting versions of his support for Theodor Herzl's Zionist schemes. Herzl wrote that Güdemann believed his book Der Judenstaat could ""work wonders,"" but Güdemann later denied this and dissociated himself from any nationalist interpretation of the Bible and its promise of Jewish redemption. 


== Published works ==
Güdemann wrote on the history of Jewish education and culture, and was associated with the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement. In addition to dozens of articles, he published the following monographs:

""Die Geschichte der Juden in Magdeburg,"" 1865
""Die Neugestaltung des Rabbinenwesens,"" 1866
""Sechs Predegten,"" 1867

39,"Morton F. Yolkut (1943–2013) was a nationally renowned rabbi who served Jewish congregations in three American cities, Chicago, Illinois; Southfield, Michigan; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  He represented the American Jewish community at a meeting in 2003 with President George W. Bush and was the Jewish rabbi at the traditional Presidential Inaugural Prayer Service at Washington National Cathedral the day after President Bush's second inauguration, January 21, 2005.
He was a published author with a regular column in Detroit Jewish News and a leader in many national organizations of rabbis and of Orthodox Judaism.


== Birthplace and education ==
Yolkut was born in St. Louis, Missouri.  He received his rabbinical degree from Hebrew Theological College of Skokie, Illinois.  He also earned degrees of Bachelor of
Arts cum laude from Roosevelt University in Chicago and Master of Arts in American history from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.


== First pulpit ==
Yolkut's first pulpit was Congregation Anshe Kanasses Israel in Chicago.
The congregation eventually merged with another congregation, and the original historic building was demolished.


== Second pulpit ==
From Chicago, Yolkut moved to Michigan to serve as rabbi at Congregation B'nai David in Southfield for 18 years.  He became a widely known Jewish leader in Michigan, serving as vice president of the Michigan Board of Rabbis and Orthodox columnist for  Detroit Jewish News, a statewide newspaper.  His ministry extended beyond preaching, as he served on the Chaplaincy Commission at Sinai Hospital in Detroit and presented papers on Jewish medical ethics to doctors and staff at local hospitals and conferences.  One aspect of Jewish medical ethics is that Judaism supports the nearly absolute sanctity of life.


== Third pulpit ==
In Yolkut's final pulpit, from 1995 to his retirement in 2008, he was rabbi of Shaare Shamayim-Beth Judah in Northeast Philadelphia.
In addition to his rabbinical responsibilities, he presided over his congregation's attempt to break the world record for dreidels spinning in unison for 10 seconds.  According to an article in Jewish Exponent on December 21, 2006, ""This was the third time Shaare Shamayim made headlines for attempting to break records in recent years. In 2002, the synagogue successfully baked the world's largest hamantashen, which measured 20 feet on each side ... In October 2005, Shaare Shamayim teamed up with Gratz College in Elkins Park to make up the largest number of people -- exactly 400 -- blowing a shofar at same time ... Yolkut said that he's proud ... that so many people came together at a time when many synagogues in the area are closing ... 'We've had some mergers with other congregations. They have brought their members and their vitality with them, so all in all, the state of our synagogue is in good shape at this point,' he said.""


== National Jewish leader ==
Yolkut served many national organizations, including Rabbinical Council of America, Federation of Traditional Rabbis, and national Rabbinic Cabinets of State of Israel Bonds, United Jewish Appeal, ORT America (formerly Organization for Educational Resources and Technological Training), and Jewish National Fund.


== Honored on the floor of Congress ==
When Yolkut became rabbi of Shaare Shamayim, U.S. Rep. Robert Borski (D., Pa.) honored him with a speech to the U.S. House of Representatives, covered by C-SPAN.


== Meetings with President George W. Bush ==
Yolkut was one of the rabbis who met with President George W. Bush at the White House in 2003 and was the Jewish rabbi at the traditional Presidential Inaugural Prayer Service at Washington National Cathedral the day after President Bush's second inauguration, January 21, 2005.


== Post-retirement ==
After retirement, Yolkut taught at Temple University in Philadelphia for two years.


== Family ==
While serving in Chicago, he married Aline Schlesinger, now a researcher at Educational Testing Services.
Schlesinger is the daughter of two Holocaust survivors who were both rescued by Oskar Schindler.  Her mother, Margot (Wind) Schlesinger is incorrectly listed as ""Hania Schlesinger"" (List 2, Line 233), and her father Charles ""Chaskel"" Schlesinger is listed by his Hebrew name, ""Abraham Schlesinger."" (List 1, Line 37) on Schindler's List.  Aline's uncle was noted German-Israeli-American artist Willie Wind.
Yolkut is survived by his wife Aline; his two sons Daniel Yolkut, the rabbi of Congregation Poale Zedeck in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and David, an attorney in Teaneck, New Jersey; and ten grandchildren.

40,"Moses Schorr, Polish: Mojżesz Schorr (May 10, 1874 – July 8, 1941) was a rabbi, Polish historian, politician, Bible scholar, assyriologist and orientalist. Schorr was one of the top experts on the history of the Jews in Poland. He was the first Jewish researcher of Polish archives, historical sources, and pinkasim. The president of the 13th district B'nai B'rith Poland, he was a humanist and modern rabbi who ministered the central synagogue of Poland during its last years before the Holocaust.
Schorr was the first historian to undertake the systematic study of Jewish history in Poland, and Galicia in particular. He made discoveries after finding and translating Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hittite legislative annals. As a scholar of the jurisprudence and civilizations of the Ancient Middle East, Schorr was a legal philosopher and sociologist of Ancient Middle Eastern societies. Schorr was appointed to the Polish Senate by Polish president Ignacy Mościcki (1926–1939). Schorr did not belong to any political party, although he was inclined to Zionism. He was active in the social, public, and religious life of Polish Jews, and was often chosen by them to head public organisations and represent Polish Jewry to Polish and international powers, though he never sought the role for himself.


== Birth and early years ==
Moses Schorr was born on May 10, 1874, in the town of Przemyśl in the province of Galicia, then a kreis town within Austro-Hungarian empire. Moses was the oldest son of Osjasz Schorr, the director of the Jewish cooperative bank in Przemyśl, and of Esther Schorr (née Friedman). He had two brothers, Adolf and Samuel, who both became lawyers in Lwów and Jarosław, respectively. Moses started his education at the Przemyśl gymnasium where he completed his studies in 1893. At gymnasium, and from his father and private teachers, he acquired the basics of Judaic lore. Among his teachers was the grandfather of an outstanding Slavist, Moshe Altbauer, who instructed Moses in the  Bible and Talmud.


== Rabbinical and philosophical studies ==
Schorr moved to Vienna, where he embarked upon the study of theology at the Israelitisch – Theologische Lehranstalt (Jewish Theological Institute) from 1893 to 1900. The institute, founded in October 1893 with the assistance of Albert von Rothschild, was modeled in part after the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. At that time it had 11 teachers and 26 students preparing for the rabbinate. Among Schorr's teachers were Adolf Schwarz in Talmud and religious-ritual codes, David Heinrich Müller in Biblical exegesis and Semitic linguistics, Adolf Bücher in Jewish history and Meir Friedman in Midrash studies. Schorr studied philosophy at University of Vienna and Lwów University  between 1893 and 1898. During his studies in Vienna, Schorr learned Hebrew and other oriental languages, showing particular interest in Egyptian mythology and psychology.
In 1898 Schorr attained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and Medieval Studies at Lwów University. In spring 1900 he received the diploma of rabbi in Vienna, being among the first dozen graduates of Rothschild's seminary.


=== Lecturing in Lwów ===
Soon after graduation he became a lecturer at the Jewish Teachers Seminary  and the Teachers Gymnasium in Lwów (now Lviv), working there until 1923, while he also engaged in educational and social work. Of his time teaching in Lwów he wrote to a Polish sociologist Ludwik Gumplowicz:

 ... For a long time I have not written to you of my old intentions to continue studying aiming at a dozent position. Besides, that ""spirit"" of semitology ... has not left me for a moment, haunting me as a shadow at every step. I have not lost contact with orientalistics, not for a bit. I have used every free minute to get acquainted with the ever growing literature, but unfortunately these free moments are quite rare. Professional work takes a lot of my time and causes a painful conflict between a forced, often mechanical work which I lack internal vocation for, and the results of my [oriental] studies ... On one hand, I do not want to be a charlatan in the profession, I even know that I have a certain mission as the religion teacher in Galicia and could even attain the ""laurels"" of the reformer in this subject. But I lack this specific ambition or enthusiasm. On the other hand, I am becoming convinced that I would have to study at least a year at the university (Berlin or Leipzig) so that I could independently work with Assyriology here. I have to admit for a moment that I have become a personality here, and everywhere they try to involve me in a friendly, humanitarian and scientific life ... and every day the circle of my ""social virtues"" widens itself — popular meetings, ceremonial speeches, committees, collectives etc., etc., — all this distracts me from my work, as I see myself suddenly thrown into the whirl of life when I would like to remain still unknown among my co-confessors. As an unripened apple I am plucked from the tree and I still miss my tree — knowledge. As for the altruistic impulses, I think that I still have enough time to realize them ...                     Lviv, January, 1901
Schorr corresponded with a number of intellectuals of that time, including Ludwig Gumplowicz, to whom he wrote at least 46 letters, and Simon Dubnow in Odessa. His correspondence with Dubnow has not been studied yet. Schorr's letters to Gumplowicz were published by R. Żebrowski.


== Studies in Semitic languages ==
Schorr received a scholarship from the Austrian Ministry of Education. He went to Berlin for two years where he studied Semitic languages, Assyriology, and the history of the ancient Orient under the guidance of famous scholars. In 1905–1906, he studied Arabic philology in Vienna under the guidance of semitologist David Heinrich Müller, who exerted a strong influence on Schorr. Müller taught Schorr Biblical criticism and Semitology at the Seminary, and a decade later, Arabic linguistics. Müller advanced a theory on the structure and form of the Biblical Psalms, which Schorr later developed in a series of articles.


== Professor at Lwów University ==
In 1904 Schorr was appointed a lecturer as privatdozent, and in March 1910, associate professor of Semitic languages and history of the Ancient Orient at Lwów University, a chair which he later held in Warsaw.
In 1904–1905 he headed the Toynbeehali, the Society for the promotion of education among Jews in Lwów. He was one of the founders and long-term members of Opieka (""Care""), a society to support Jewish Youth in the secondary schools. During his stay in Lwów, Schorr was one of the founders and the first head of the ""Society of the teachers of Moses religion of the people's secondary schools of Galicia"". He led the first teachers' congress in 1904 in Lwów. He was a member of the board of the Jewish Community Library in Lwów from its inception, and later was its head.


=== Relation to Zionism ===
Schorr took part in the 7th Zionist Congress of 1910 in Basel. The Congress and his stay in Switzerland made an impression on Schorr, as he writes to Gumplowicz:

There is no need to stress how strong an impression I got from the wonderful views of Swiss nature. I will stay here in Basel for 14 days for the whole duration of the 7th Zionist Congress, which is going to start on Thursday. Already today there are several hundred guests, most from Russia, among them the outstanding Jewish figures, and many ladies, as well. Already today, the Congress seems to me to be the most powerful manifestation of Jewish solidarity around the world. During the entire course of Jewish history, there was no such movement that would so deeply enter the consciousness of all the Jews with such an enthusiasm. But already nowadays various groups with different tendencies are being formed, away from the main fundamental idea.
Schorr took part in the conference but did not make any public speeches. Regarding the Zionist movement, he wrote:

As for the Zionist movement ... I am noting in advance, that in my opinion the historical proofs can not be decisive for the present. After all, Professor Winkler proved that the Jews had never been to Egypt but does this mean that the Jewish religion, that is based on the fact of the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt and its consequences, should disappear from history?
Żebrowski presumes that Schorr's participation in the Congress was perhaps one of the reasons that a rich merchant, a banker and fervent Zionist, chose Schorr as a husband for his daughter Tamara. They were married in the synagogue of Prussian Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad) on 31 October 1905.


=== Professor in Semitic languages ===
In April 1916 Schorr received the degree of merited professor of Lwów University in the field of Semitic languages and Ancient Oriental history, combining this post with other duties at the same university until 1923. In 1912 he participated in the international congress of orientalists in Athens, where he was one of the secretaries of the semitology section and presented a lecture entitled ""Sumerian and Semitic Beginnings of the Ancient Babylonian Law"", which was published in the Paris edition of Revue Semitique. In 1918 he became a member of the Oriental committee at the Kraków Academy, and in 1920 a member of the Polish Scientific Society in Lwów, and in 1923 one of the founders of the Polish Oriental Society in Lwów.
In 1917-1918 he headed the Jewish Rescue Committee in Lwów, and from 1916 on he was a member of the central committee to help the Jewish orphans in the city. The Society of Jewish National and Secondary school, which was established at the beginning of 1919, chose him its first head, and in 1920 entitled him a merited member of the society.


== Transfer to Warsaw ==

Schorr moved to Warsaw in 1923. He was invited to Warsaw to succeed Samuel Poznański as preacher at the Great Synagogue, Warsaw on Tłomackie street. Designed to seat 1,100, it was the largest synagogue and community in Europe and second largest in the world, behind only New York. The Warsaw Judaic community numbered 352,659 Jews in the 1931 census. Schorr also became a member of the Warsaw rabbinical council, one of the top Jewish religious authorities in Poland. Some of his preachings were published. He was elected to the position of inter-regional rabbi whose main duties and functions were to represent the Jewish community in front of the state and administrative authorities. Schorr was appointed a member of the city and regional School Councils by the Jewish community board.
In 1924 he became the head of the State Examination Committee for Jewish teachers of religion and Judaic subjects in secondary schools, and a member of the Ministerial Commission for the evaluation of school handbooks in the field of Judaica.


== Warsaw University ==
In 1926 Schorr became a professor at the University of Warsaw. Schorr headed the Institute of Semitic languages and history of the Ancient Orient. In 1927 he initiated the creation of the Committee for setting up the Jewish Library at the Great Synagogue in Warsaw and became its head. This library was completed in 1936. Today the library building houses the Jewish Historical Institute.


=== Institute of Judaic Sciences in Warsaw ===
In February 1928 Schorr, together with M. Balaban, Tohn and Braud, founded the Institute of Judaic Sciences for the research of Judaic sciences and Judaism, in particular Biblical subjects, philosophy, religion, Talmud, sociology, Semitic languages and Hebrew literature. It was located on the site of the present-day Jewish Historical Institute, beside the Great Synagogue. It functioned on a state budget, with donations from foreign Jewish institutions. The Institute retained a library which numbered over 35,000 books, documents and magazines. Professor Schorr became the first rector of the newly created institution, and served in that capacity during 1928-1930 and 1933-34.
In 1933-1934 he was elected a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and in 1935 a member of the Finnish Oriental Society in Helsinki. In 1937 Schorr received the title of merited doctor from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York.


== Schorr and B'nai B'rith ==
From 1901 on, Schorr was a member of the humanitarian society B'nai B'rith ""Leopolis"" in Lwów, where for a few years he led the library. The B'nai B'rith ""Leopolis"" was founded in 1889 and since 1932 had its own building at 3 Maja street, 10. The archival documentation of B'nai B'rith ""Leopolis"" has been partially preserved and is still to be studied. From 1922 ""Leopolis"" was incorporated into the 13th district of B'nai B'rith Poland and numbered 217 persons, the largest lodge in Poland.
From 1921 Schorr was the president of the Lwów branch of B'nai B'rith in Galicia, part of the 12th district of B'nai B'rith Austria.
In 1922 Schorr was elected the vice president of the Polish district, while the president was  lawyer Dr Adolf Ader from Kraków. From 1924 he was the president of the lodge Braterstwo (""Brotherhood"") in Warsaw. This lodge numbered 85 members, including 32 merchants, 14 physicians, 13 engineers, eight lawyers, eight industrialists, six bankers, one writer, three senators (Moses Koerner, Schorr, and banker Rafael Szereszowski), one deputy (lawyer Dr Apolinary Hartgas) and two professors — Schorr and his close colleague, historian and friend Meir Balaban. The lodge reached its highest membership in 1931, when it had 130 members. After Schorr's resignation from its presidency, his role was taken over by Meir Balaban and consequently the lodge was headed by lawyer Maurycy Edelman, merchant Maurycy Meyzel, Seminary director Meir Tauber and lawyer Ignacy Bamberg.
The headquarters of Warsaw Braterstwo lodge were located at Rymarska 8 street. In the years of his presidency, Schorr organised many initiatives, undertakings, and cultural events, managed the meetings of so-called ""speaking diaries"" with the participation of renown personalities, writers and publicists. He took part in the creation of Auxilium Academicum Judaicum, an organisation formed for the erection of the Jewish Academic House in Warsaw. Schorr's brotherhood played a role in the founding of the Reform Institute of Judaic Sciences and the publishing society Menora that published the magazine Miesięcznik Żydowski (Jewish Monthly, 1930–1935), which was under the influence of B'nai B'rith. Through the Warsaw lodge, Schorr co-organised and supported the Relief Committee for the Jewish victims of the economic crisis, continuing his role in the religious affairs of the nomination of rabbis and Orthodox influences. While heading the Warsaw lodge, Schorr set up a special literary award for an outstanding writer of Jewish origin.
Rich members of the lodge played an important role in the charity activities of the lodge. Among them was a friend of Schorr, wood merchant Horacy Heller, who assigned for social activities 20,000 dollars. Significant sums were donated by his colleagues, banker Szereszowski (one of two Jewish colleagues in the Polish Senate), Dr. Joseph Landau, industrialist Maurycy Raabe, and others. In the years 1937–1938, a violent anti-Masonic campaign took place in Poland that led to the special decree of 1938 that dissolved any sort of free Masonic societies, including B'nai B'rith.
Moses Schorr performed the functions of vice president of the B'nai B'rith Lodge ""Solidaność"" (Solidarity) in Kraków. There are dozens of letters written by Schorr preserved in the B'nai B'rith collection of the State Archives in that city. During his presidency Schorr corresponded with a number of B'nai B'rith officials, including the Secretary of the Great Conventional Lodge in Chicago. Polish historian Dr Bogusława Czajecka delivered a paper ""Moses Schorr as social activist in the light of B'nai B'rith documents (1922–1938)"" during the scientific session on Schorr at the Polish Academy of Arts in Kraków in 1993.
Schorr's views on B'nai B'rith's goals and their practical application in terms of social activities are expressed in his work (in Polish) ""Ideals of the Order B'nai B'rith and their Application Towards Real Life Conditions."" Schorr describes B'nai B'rith as follows:

 ... The union of B'nai B'rith, as an international organization (...) is characterized by two fundamental principles: the idea of solidarity of all the Jews in the entire world (...), the idea of universalism of humanity, the brotherhood of all the peoples and nations (...). These two ideas I consider for the highest goal of our spiritual and intellectual program ... 
Schorr's initiative helped with the creation of the Lodge ""Montefiory"" in Łódź, then the second largest Jewish urban community in Poland, with 222,497 Jews. In 1928 lodges ""Montefiore"" and ""Braterstwo"" took up the discussion concerning the official name of the organisation, arguing between B'nai B'riss and B'nei B'rith formulations. Schorr's suggestion ""...taking into consideration the scientific and practical views, the name of the order should be written ""B’nei B’rith""  was adopted unanimously.
Schorr authored an appeal of the information bureau of the lodge ""Braterstwo"" about the situation of the Jews in Germany and other countries after 1933. Schorr was a member of the committee which managed the bureau. His goal in the activity of B'nai B'rith was to unify the principle of national solidarity among the Jews with the ideas of universalism.


== Schorr and political life ==
Though Schorr did not take an active part in political life, he participated as a scientific expert in a questionary campaign about the problems of the Jewish community in Poland arranged in February 1919 by the Governmental Commission. The protocols of the campaign were published in a separate book, W sprawie polsko-żydowskiej. Ankieta (""Concerning the Polish-Jewish question. Questionnary"").
Schorr concentrated mainly on scientific work, teaching, and social activities, rather than politics, but in 1935, the president of Poland Ignacy Mościcki named him Senator in the parliament. In his parliamentary speeches, along with articles in the Jewish press, such as Nasz Przegląd and Chwila, Schorr expressed his concern about the growth of antisemitism in Poland and the passive conduct of the authorities in this regard. He led the Jewish immigration and colonial committee, which aimed to make possible the Jewish immigration from Poland to countries other than Palestine. He participated in the Évian Conference in France on the problem faced by 500,000 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria with the advent of the Nazi regime and the Anschluss of Austria in 1938. The Évian Conference, held in Évian-les-Bains on the French shore of Lake Geneva, was convened at the initiative of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who invited European, American, and Australian delegates for an open discussion on organising the resettlement and immigration of those who experienced persecution on the basis of religion or race. Schorr was one of the key speakers in Évian and was highly involved as many Jews fled Germany for Poland.  Golda Meir represented Palestine as an observer.


== Last years ==
After the beginning of World War II, Schorr entered the Jewish Civil Committee and on 6 or 7 September he left Warsaw. He knew that the Nazis would not spare him, as he was an active Jewish social leader who often spoke against fascism in the parliament. These fears forced him and his wife, Tamara, to escape eastwards. His daughter Felicia lived in the town of Ostróg near Równe with her three children (two her own and one of her sister Sonia). Moses and Tamara Schorr reached Ostróg on 27 September.


=== Arrest by NKVD ===

The appearance of Schorr was quickly noted by Soviet securities in the town. Two days after his arrival, Schorr was arrested by Ostróg NKVD (Soviet secret police) branch, and was kept in custody in the local prison for a week. Later he was transferred to the nearby regional administrative center of Łuck, where he spent another week in prison.


=== Confinement and questioning ===
On 24 of September he transferred to Lwów where he had lived until 1923. In confinement, Schorr was forced to fill in a questionnaire, was photographed, and had his personal belongings taken: his golden watch, pen, scissors, organiser, a file of photos. The scholar was asked when, by whom and why was he appointed for the Senator's position, when did he become a rabbi, and to which party did he belong. Schorr answered that President Mościcki appointed him to the Polish Senate in the capacity of Rabbi of Warsaw and that he did not belong to any political party. The prosecutor noted down only his words concerning his rabbinical functions and an account of the marriage of Schorr's daughter Sophia (residing in Paris) with an official of the Polish Ministry of Justice. Schorr's wife and daughter Felicia moved to Lwów, where Felicia worked as a waitress.


=== Imprisonment at Lubyanka ===
On February 3, the newly appointed Russian prosecutor of the Lvov branch of the NKVD, Lopunov, received an order from the Deputy of the Peoples Committee of the Ministry for State Security V.N. Merkulov to send him to Moscow for a continuation of the investigation. Schorr was sent in convoy to the First Special Department of the Soviet NKVD. In the accompanying documentation, he was noted to be ""healthy"".
In Moscow he was held in Lubyanka Prison, in the same cell with the Bund activist Victor Alter, the poet Władysław Broniewski, and the Polish Senator of the National Party professor Stanisław Głąbiński. The Polish nationalist later recollected that became such close friends that they slept together on one bench. In the accounts of cell inmate Mrs. Wisia Wagner from 10 August 1943 we read:

Cell no. 21 was little. It housed 30 persons. Among them the main rabbi of Warsaw, renowned scientist, professor of Warsaw University Dr Moses Schorr, the activist of Bund Victor Alter, Senator professor Stanisław Gląbiński – the leader of Polish National Democrats and other personalities, who formed the intellectual elite of Poland. I spent a few days together with Professor Schorr. Despite his elderly age, he was constantly taken for torturing questioning and beaten. He was awakened in the middle of the night, led away for many hours and only in the morning returned. As he told us in the cell, he was accused of belonging to the protagonists of the bourgeois government. I spent 10 days with Prof Schorr and was astonished by his spiritual posture, despite the sufferings, he did not allow himself to get broken and after questioning was coming back calm and full of dignity. By chance he happened to share his cell with the leader of Endecja [Polish Nationalist Party pursuing the policy of tough assimilation of the minorities]. The representative of Jewish people and former antisemite went into so friendly a relationship that they slept on the same cell bed. After 10 days Prof Schorr was driven off from our prison and I have not seen him ever since.


=== Liberation attempts ===
The attempts to liberate Schorr, which were undertaken by the Polish government-in-exile with the mediation of the Vatican and the United States Department of State did not succeed. In February 1940, Cordell Hull, as Secretary of State during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, appealed to the Soviet powers through the mediation of international organisations to find Schorr and rescue him from the Soviet prisons. This did not produce any results. The President of the Council of Ministers of the Polish government in exile, Władysław Sikorski, applied to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of his government with the following letter:

I ask you Sir Minister about the entreatment of our Ambassador in the Vatican with the intervention, aimed to free Professor Schorr, arrested by the Bolshevik powers in Lwów. I consider the diplomatic means through Vatican to be the most advisable solution of this matter. After release, I ask you to direct Professor Schorr to France. Head of the Council of Ministers – Gen. Div. Sikorski.


=== Concentration camp and death ===
On 17 April 1941, Schorr was assigned to five years of mandatory prison labour. He was taken to the NKVD's fifth concentration camp in Posty, Uzbekistan, where he fell ill and died in a camp hospital on 8 July 1941. He was buried in grave no. C-30 on the grounds of the hospital. Polish authorities  learned of his death only on the eve of 1942, after diplomatic relations were established between the Polish London government and the Soviet government. The Polish government had been trying to liberate him a second time, planning to appoint him to the post of the main Rabbi of the Anders Army, which was forming at that time, but it was too late.
Jewish publisher A. Sztibel wrote the following lines about Schorr :

At every ship arriving in America from Europe, nearly every Polish Jew claims to be the leader of the Jews of Poland. These are the people, whose names I never heard, despite the fact that I was born and brought up in Poland. In the meanwhile professor Schorr, a real authority of Polish Jewry, is kept in Bolshevik prisons and no one makes the slightest effort to rescue him ... (A. Sztibel, letter to Cyrus Adler)


== Schorr's family ==
After the German attack of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa—June 1941), Schorr's wife,  daughter Felicia, and grandchildren, left Lwów for Warsaw. They endured internment in the Warsaw ghetto, but obtained Costa Rican and Nicaraguan passports (from daughter Sonia). They were next interned at Warsaw's Pawiak Prison on 19 June 1942 as citizens of a neutral state. After several months, they were transferred to the French town of Vittel in Alsace, where they arrived on 20 October 1943, to be exchanged for German prisoners of war. In Vittel, they were held in a special hotel guarded by the Gestapo along with 300 other Jews with foreign passports.
After more than a year of waiting, it became clear that the next day they would all be deported to the Drancy internment camp, from where detainees were transported to Auschwitz. Tamara Schorr and her daughter Felicia Kon decided to commit suicide on 17 April 1944 so that Felicia's children, as orphans, could avoid transfer. Tamara Schorr died after consuming poison. Her daughter Felicia was wounded after she jumped out a window, and was taken to hospital. Their other daughter, Sonia, managed to reach New York City with her husband Arthur Miller toward the end of 1940.


=== Children ===
Schorr was married in 1905 to Tamara Ben Jacob, the daughter of Yitzhak Ben Jacob (1858–1926), a publisher, Zionist, banker and bibliographer from Wilno. They had six children:

Sonia, wife of Arthur Miller, the prosecutor of the Warsaw High Court and the head of the Criminal law Department at the Ministry of Justice of Poland; she died in 1961.
Deborah (died in Lwów in 1917)
Felicia Kon-Lipets; (died in New York City in 1984)
Ludwig (1918–1963), an architect who settled in Tel Aviv
Esther, in marriage Ben-Kohav (died in Jerusalem in 1991)
Joshua (Otton), an engineer in Jerusalem who died in 2005


== Awards and remembrances ==
Schorr was awarded Poland's Golden Cross of Merit. His name is listed on the memorial next to the Polish Parliament erected in memory of the Senators of the II Polish Republic who perished at the hands of the NKVD and the Nazis.
A scientific meeting was devoted to Schorr. In 1993 a similar meeting took place at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Kraków. In 2001 an Educational Center named in honor of Prof. Moses Schorr was established in Warsaw, aimed at the education of the Jewish community remaining in Poland. Schorr Center was founded as one of the projects of Ronald Lauder Foundation to cultivate Jewish literacy, culture, and history among Jews all over Poland.


=== Streets in Israel named after Schorr ===
There are streets named after Schorr in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Holon.


== Scientific legacy ==
The first stream of Schorr's scientific activity deals with the history of Polish Jews. Schorr's historiographic approach and view upon the methodology applied to the study of the history of Polish Jewry is summarized in his own writing:

The major defect of the methods of research of Jewish history in Poland is that the general issues were studied before the details had been exposed. There was attempt to present the history of the Jews in entire Poland, before this history had been reviewed in specific cities. The historical entireness was treated, before the elemental processes had been exposed. 
Therefore, also today's general works on the history of Polish Jewry, and they are few after all, are characterised by the dilettante forms, lacking integrity, accurateness and clarity in subject presentation. Their material used is meager and not sufficient to encompass the entirety of the history of Polish Jewry, neither in the political-economic sphere nor in the cultural developments. An appropriate solid basis for such a general task can only be constructed by virtue of the archival material, which is so abundantly accumulated in different archives and partially the libraries. The fundamental, scientific presentation of the entire history will only be possible when the factual historical, economic and cultural developments in the major cities will be multilaterally studied on the basis of archival sources. Publication and analysis of the archival documents should be the first task preceding the general studies.""  — M. Schorr. Lwów, October 1902
The techniques and methods Schorr used in historical studies were far ahead of his young age (28) and the time in which he worked. He began his scientific work as an auditor in Vienna University in 1897 with his paper entitled Zur Geschichte des Don Josef Nasi (""Concerning the history of Don Joseph Nasi""), which was published in Monatschrift fur die Wiessenschaft des Judenstum. In this work he analyses the relations of Joseph Nasi (1524-1579) with the Polish king Sigismund August (1520-1572) in light of the situation of Jews in Poland at that time. Joseph Nasi was a Portuguese born marrano (secret Jew) appointed the Lord of Tiberias and the Duke of Naxos and the Seven Islands. He was one of the first Zionists and an influential Ottoman statesman during the reign of Selim II (1566–1574). Schorr analysed the relations of Joseph Nasi with Poland. Though he was a 20-year-old student at the time, he corrected a fundamental error of Graetz, a leading historian, who claimed that Sigismund August acknowledged a number of commercial privileges for the Polish Jews by virtue of the services of Joseph Nasi to Polish diplomacy at the Ottoman court. On the basis of sources found by Schorr in the historical city archives of Lwów, he came to the conclusion that Joseph Nasi was not guided by altruism but wanted the privilege to trade in Lwów for himself, and obtained it.


=== Doctoral dissertation ===
Schorr's doctoral dissertation, entitled Organizacja Żydów w Polsce (""The Organisation of Jews in Poland""), was first published in Lwów's historical quarterly, Kwartalnik historyczny in 1899, and was later translated into Russian and published in Voskhod. In 1903 Schorr was awarded the Wawelberg Prize (provided by the famous Polish-Russian banker and philanthropist) for his work Żydzi w Przemyślu do roku 1772 (""Jews in Przemyśl until 1772""). It was republished in 1991 in Jerusalem with an introduction by Jakub Goldberg and an epilogue by his last surviving son, Joshua Otton Schorr. The Organisation of Jews in Poland is a serious attempt to summarise the data about the Qahal organisation of the central institutions of Jewish self-administration—the vaads and the brotherhoods of Jewish craftsmen. Schorr wrote to Ludwik Gumplowicz from Vienna in October 1897:

 ... the organization of Jews in Poland is thus one of the most important and the most interesting parts of Jewish culture in Poland; I will only note the huge importance ""the council of four lands"" had directing the life of Polish Jews for 200 years. In general, my intention is to devote myself to the study of Jewish history in Poland. For the next task of mine I consider the publication of the most important archival documents concerning the Jews—the way Bershadsky began that already. During my search of the City Historical Archives in Lwów, I became convinced that there are real treasures for the history of Polish Jews. I am staying all the time in Vienna, except holidays. I still have 1½ years until finishing my theological studies. I doubt very much that I will be following the profession of a preacher [rabbi] in practice. I am more fond of scientific work. I repeat that your interest in my historical works is a good stimulus for me; that motivates me even more to my intended research .... 


=== Monograph ""Jews in Przemyśl"" ===
Another work, the monograph about the Jews in Przemyśl, is precious not only for its concise examination of the history of this community but also for the numerous Polish, Latin, and Hebrew documents from the 16th to 18th centuries concerning the history of the Przemyśl Jewish community, which are added at the end of the book: nearly half of the work. Schorr starts his historical account from the early 15th century, when the first Jews began to appear sporadically in significant numbers in the major cities of Czerwona Rus' Red Ruthenia: Lwów, Halicz, Przemyśl and Sanok. The first historical mention of Jews in Przemyśl dates  from 1466, and Schorr included next a review of the privileges of Sigismund II August (1548–1572); a statute ad bonum ordinem of Stephen Báthory of Poland (king of Poland from 1576 to 1586) and other privileges; contracts; antisemitic assaults; and documents about internal Jewish organisation. The last chapter deals with the Jewish professional brotherhoods, including Jewish artisan and tailor fraternities—their emergence, organisation, and role in society. The author  notes Jewish religious societies such as the Society of Psalms Readers (whose task was gathering in synagogue each day before sunrise to recite the psalms) and the Chevra kadisha (the holy society responsible for burying the dead). Schorr explores the pinkasim (books or journals) of the brotherhoods. He was the first to note the existence of Jewish artisan brotherhoods in that period after finding the records of the Przemyśl guild of Jewish artisans from the 17th and 18th centuries. The wide usage of pinkasim for historical studies was innovative at that time.
Among the wide range of sources presented in the second part of the book we find the first fundamental privilege given by king Sigismund II August to the Jews of Przemyśl in 1559, allowing them to live there with the same rights and freedoms as other townsmen (no. 1); the Order of Sigismund II August to the mayor and counselors regarding the attack on the Jews in 1561 (no. 2); the contract of 1595 between the town hall and Jewish elders on the matter of Jewish participation in the fortification of the city (no. 20); the protest of town pharmacists against the Jewish elders for the production of medical items by the Jews in 1677 (no. 121); the order of the governor of Rus' lands Jabłonowski allowing a free election of a rabbi after the ardent requests of ""unfaithful"" Jewish elders and the whole synagogue of Przemyśl (no. 130). Several Polish sources from 1759 published in this edition (nos. 143 – 144) deal with charges against the Jews of Stupnica in a supposed ritual Easter murder, their tortures and refusal of the charges, and the consequent execution of the accused. A similar Polish document (no. 76) from the year 1646 deals with charges of ritual child murder against twelve Przemyśl Jews, one of whom was punished. Schorr preserves the archaic form of the old Polish language in the documents which gives them a special character.


=== Work on Jewish laws and privileges ===
Schorr published The Cracow code of Jewish laws and privileges in Poland, and wrote an article about its significance and the contradictory questions regarding the main privileges.
Schorr is the author of a lengthy article about the Hebrew language in the Encyklopedja Polska (Polish Encyclopedia, vol. III, 1915). One of his last works in the field of Jewish history in Poland, is Rechtsstellung und innere Verfassung der Juden in Polen (""The Legal Situation and Internal Organisation of Jews in Poland""), published in German in Berlin and Vienna in 1917.


=== Schorr as Orientalist ===
The second major stream of Schorr's scientific activity concerns Bible studies (in particular research of Biblical Law), Assyriology, and the history of the Ancient Near East in general. Schorr's works were mainly focused on these subjects from 1904. Schorr's switch to Oriental studies was caused partly by professional circumstances: Polish historian Krzysztof Pilarczyk notes that Schorr could not be assured of a professorship in the field of Jewish history in Poland. In 1902 Schorr became interested in the newly discovered Hammurabi Code and thus in the laws of Ancient Babylon and Assyria. Schorr's interest was rooted in his religious beliefs and interest in the Bible and Oriental and Egyptian mythology. His years at the gymnasium and university prepared him to study texts in the Hebrew, Assyrian, and Babylonian languages.
His first works in Oriental studies included a paper on the excavations and discoveries at Amarna (1900), followed by the investigation of Starożytności biblijne w swietle archiwum egipskiego (""Biblical Antiquities in the Light of the Egyptian Archive""). This was published in the magazine Przewodnik naukowy i literacki in 1901 and separately as well. In 1903 Schorr commented extensively on Babel und Bibel (""Babylon and Bible""), a book by his former German tutor Friedrich Delitzsch (1902). Schorr's commentary, ""Kultura Babilońska a starohebrajska"" (""Babylonian and Hebrew Culture""), appeared in Lwów's Kwartalnik historyczny and later in a separate edition. Kwartalnik Historyczny was the major publication for Lwów historians at that time and Schorr was one of its regular contributors.
Some of Schorr's works were written and published in German, his second native language; German was then an official Habsburg language in Eastern Galicia, along with Polish and Ukrainian. One such study is Die Kohler-Peiserische Hammurabi Übersetzung (""The Peiser-Kohler Translation of the Hammurabi Code).


=== Research on Babylonian history ===
Schorr's main work on the subject of Babylonian history was Państwo i społeczeństwo babilońśke w kresie t.zw. dynastyi Hammurabiego (""The Babylonian State and Society at the Time of the Hammurabi Dynasty); this was published as a separate volume in 1906 in Lwów and later was published in Kwartalnik historyczny.  Another work by Schorr in German is Eine Babylonische Seisachtie aus dem Anfang der Kassitenzeit, ende XVIII vorchristl. Jahrhunderts (""The Babylonian Seisachtie of the Times of the Kassites Dynasty, the End of 18th century BC""). In this paper Schorr presents and discusses an ancient Babylonian text newly discovered by the Oxford Assyriologist Stephen Herbert Langdon.
He conducted research on the history of the social and commercial life of the Ancient Orient, and particularly trade in ancient Babylon. The work's title is Ruch handlowy w Satorożytnej Babilonii (""The trade movement in old Babylon""). It was published in 1911 in a commemorative book celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of Lwów University.
Schorr translated and systematised old Babylonian legal documents and wrote an extensive commentary entitled Altbabylonische Rechtsurkunden aus der Zeit der I -ste Babylonische Dynastie (""Old Babylonian legal documents from the First Babylonian dynasty""). The legal issues and the legal history of the laws were the main subjects of Schorr's research. He did significant research in comparative studies of the legal systems of Babylon and the surrounding cultures of that time, in particular the Hebrew legal system.
Kodeks Hammurabiego a ówczesna praktyka prawna (""The Hammurabi Code and Ancient Oriental Legal Practices"") first appeared in Rozprawy (Studies) of the historical department of Kraków Academy of Sciences; in 1907 it was published separately.
Schorr's Urkunden des altbabylonische Zivil- und Prozessrechts (""The Documents of the Old Babylonian Civil and Criminal Law) is considered to be his greatest scholarly achievement in the Oriental field. It is a volume of sources with extensive comments by Schorr.


== Publications in Zionist daily Chwila ==
Schorr actively cooperated with the Lwów Zionist newspaper Chwila (""The Wave""), published in  the inter-war period. These articles remain unexamined by historians. The newspapers for 1918-1939 are kept in the scientific library of Lwów University. The most important articles are Palestyna a Babylon w świetle najnowszych wykopalisk (""Palestine and Babylon in the Light of Recent Archaeological Excavations"", 1923); and Samuel Hirsch Margulies (1922), which is dedicated to Galicia native Samuel Hirsch Margulies (1858–1922), who became the leader of Italian Jewry. This article was in commemoration of Margulies, who had died that year. In the  obituary, Schorr writes:

Italian Jewry has undergone a great loss in the death of the Rabbi of Florence and rector of local rabbinical seminary Dr. Samuel Hirsch Margulies (died on March 12), who had been the Rabbi for more than three decades leaving a strong footprint on a life and culture of the Jews of whole Italy. Margulies was of Polish origin...In 1890 he was called for the position of the Rabbi of Florence, where he managed to become the leader of whole Italian Jewry. He became the spiritual leader in all the spheres of the civic life, on account of his deep Judaic knowledge, organisational abilities and personal favourite pursuits in the subjects of spirit and heart. Thanks to him the indifferent religious life of Italian Jews started to be a live artery filled with strong native Jewish traditions and culture. He also initiated the centralized unification of all Jewish communities which created a new Collegio rabbinico italiano...in Florence...This seminary produced an array of young Rabbis, who started the spiritual renaissance of Italian Jewry.""
Schorr's broadest article in Chwila was Prawo Mojżesza na tle poròwnawczem prawodawst Starożytnego Wschodu (The Laws of Moses in Comparative Perspective with the Laws of the Ancient Orient""). This work was a series of articles in several newspaper issues, where Schorr draws  comparisons between Biblical and Babylonian laws in the first part of the series, following with a comparison with the Assyrian and Hettite legislatures in the second and third sections. Schorr also refers back to his previous work, The Hettites' Problem, published seven years before in Kwartalnik historyczny.
A few other newly discovered publications of Schorr should be mentioned include Kwestya żydowska w dobie Sejmu Wiekiego (""The Jewish Question at the Time of the Great Sejm""); religious teachings such as Radosna Chwila (""The Joyful Moment""), and Pesach Micarim - Pesach le Atid on the occasion of the Easter celebration.

41,"Moses Vita Ascarelli (Hebrew: משה יחיאל עזכאריאל, Italian: Mosè Vita Ascarelli; 5 April 1826 – 11 December 1889), also known by the pen name Emet le-Ya'akov (Hebrew: אמת ליעקב), was an Italian physician, rabbi, writer, poet, and translator.


== Biography ==
Moses Vita Ascarelli was born to a Jewish family in Rome in 1826. He received his religious education at the Talmud Torah and Rabbinical College in that city, and later studied medicine at the University of Rome. He distinguished himself during the cholera epidemic in 1867, in recognition of which he received a medal from Pope Pius IX. Ascarelli took an active interest in the organization of the Jewish community in Rome; he was one of the founders of the Società di fratellanza, for the dissemination of education and development of the arts among poor Jews, and, together with Pellegrino Pontecorvo, co-founder of the Roman branch of the Alliance Israélite Universelle.
Ascarelli was a frequent contributor under the pseudonym ""Emet le-Ya'akov"" to the Hebrew journal Ha-Maggid, for which he wrote many poems and articles on the condition of Italian Jews under Pope Pius IX. Ascarelli translated from Hebrew into Italian the work Naḥalah le-Yisrael ('A Heritage unto Israel'), a responsum sent by Chief Rabbi Israel Moses Hazan in connection with a disputed inheritance in the Gallichi family. Ascarelli also published Sefer 'am Polanim ve-gere Polanim, a translation of Adam Mickiewicz's Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego from Armand Lévy's French translation. He served as rabbi of the Scola Catalana synagogue, and one of his sermons was published under the title Panegirico sull' elezione d'Israele letto nel Tempio israelitico di Roma (Scuola Catalana) il Sciavuot 5640 (17 maggio 1880) per l'iniziazione alla maggiorità religiose del figlio Angelo Raffaele e altri giovanetti della Communione.

42,"Moshe Feinstein (Hebrew: משה פײַנשטיין; Lithuanian pronunciation: Moshe Faynshteyn; English: Moses Feinstein; March 3, 1895 – March 23, 1986) was a Russian-born American Orthodox Jewish rabbi, scholar, and posek (authority on halakha—Jewish law). He has been called the most famous Orthodox Jewish legal authority of the twentieth century and  his rulings are often referenced in contemporary rabbinic literature. Feinstein served as president of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis, Chairman of the Council of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of the Agudath Israel of America, and head of Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem in New York.
Feinstein is commonly referred to simply as ""Reb Moshe"" (or ""Rav Moshe"").


== Biography ==
Rabbi Moshe Feinstein was born, according to the Hebrew calendar, on Adar 7, 5655 (traditionally the date of birth and death of the biblical Moshe, the reason that he was given his name), in Uzda, near Minsk, Belarus (then part of the Russian Empire). His father, Rabbi David Feinstein, was the rabbi of Uzda and a great-grandson of the Vilna Gaon's brother. David Feinstein's father, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Feinstein, was a Koidanover Chassid.  His mother was a descendant of talmudist Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller, the Shlah HaKadosh, and Rashi. He studied with his father and in yeshivas located in Slutsk, under Pesach Pruskin, and Shklov. He also had a close relationship with his uncle, Yaakov Kantrowitz, rabbi of Timkovichi, whom he greatly revered and considered his mentor. For the rest of his life, Feinstein considered Pruskin as his rebbe.
Feinstein was appointed rabbi of Lyuban, where he served for sixteen years. He married Shima Kustanovich in 1920 and had four children (Pesach Chaim, Fay Gittel, Shifra, and David) before leaving Europe. Pesach Chaim died in Europe, and another son, Reuven, was born in the United States. Under increasing pressure from the Soviet regime, he moved with his family to New York City in January 1937, where he lived for the rest of his life.
Settling on the Lower East Side, he became the rosh yeshiva of Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem. He later established a branch of the yeshiva in Staten Island, New York, now headed by his son Reuven Feinstein. His son Dovid Feinstein headed the Manhattan branch.
He was president of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada, and chaired the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Agudath Israel of America from the 1960s until his death. Feinstein also took an active leadership role in Israel's Chinuch Atzmai.
Feinstein was recognized by many as the preeminent halachic authority (posek) of his generation; ruling on issues of Jewish law as they pertain to modern times. People from around the world called upon him to answer their most complicated halachic questions.


== Halachic authority ==

Owing to his prominence as an adjudicator of Jewish law, Feinstein was often asked to rule on very difficult questions, whereupon  he often employed a number of innovative and controversial theories in arriving at his decisions. Soon after arriving in the United States, he established a reputation for handling business and labor disputes. For instance, he wrote about strikes, seniority, and fair competition. He later served as the chief Halakhic authority for the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists, indicative of his expertise in Jewish medical ethics. In the medical arena, he opposed the early, unsuccessful heart transplants, although it is orally reported that in his later years, he allowed a person to receive a heart transplant (after the medical technique of preventing rejection was improved). On such matters, he often consulted with various scientific experts, including his son-in-law Moshe David Tendler, who was a professor of biology and served as a rosh yeshiva at Yeshiva University.
As one of the prominent leaders of American Orthodoxy, Feinstein issued opinions that clearly distanced his community from Conservative and Reform Judaism. He faced intense opposition from Hasidic Orthodoxy on several controversial decisions, such as rulings on artificial insemination and mechitza. In the case of his position not to prohibit cigarette smoking, though he recommended against it and prohibited second-hand smoke, other Orthodox rabbinic authorities disagreed. Even his detractors, while disagreeing with specific rulings, still considered him to be a leading decisor of Jewish law. The first volume of his Igrot Moshe, a voluminous collection of his halachic decisions, was published in 1959.


== Death ==

Feinstein died on March 23, 1986 (13th of Adar II, 5746). Over 20,000 people gathered to hear him eulogized in New York before he was flown to Israel for burial.
His funeral in Israel was delayed by a day due to mechanical problems with the plane carrying his coffin, which then had to return to New York. His funeral in Israel was said to be attended by between 200,000 and 250,000 people.
Feinstein was buried on Har HaMenuchot near his teacher, Isser Zalman Meltzer.

== Works ==
Feinstein wrote approximately 2,000 responsa on a wide range of issues affecting Jewish practice in the modern era. Some responsa can also be found in his Talmudic commentary (Dibrot Moshe), some circulate informally, and 1,883 responsa were published in Igrot Moshe. Among Feinstein's works:

Igrot Moshe; (Epistles of Moshe); pronounced Igros Moshe by Yiddish speakers (such as Feinstein); Halachic responsa in 7 volumes published during his lifetime and widely referenced by contemporary halachic authorities. The final, seventh volume was published in two different forms, the resulting variations found in a total of 65 responsa. An additional 2 volumes were published posthumously from manuscripts and oral dictations that were transcribed by others.
Dibrot Moshe (Moshe's Words); pronounced Dibros Moshe by Yiddish speakers such as Feinstein himself; a 14 volume work of Talmudic novellae with additional volumes being published by the Feinstein Foundation and being coordinated by his grandson, Mordecai Tendler.
Darash Moshe (Moshe Expounds, a reference to Leviticus 10:16), a posthumously published volume of novellae on the weekly synagogue Torah reading. [Artscroll subsequently translated this as a two-volume English work.]
Kol Ram (High Voice); 3 volumes, printed in his lifetime by Avraham Fishelis, the director of his yeshiva.
Some of Feinstein's early works, including a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud, were lost in Communist Russia, though his first writings are being prepared for publication by the Feinstein Foundation.
Feinstein is known for writing, in a number of places, that certain statements by prominent rishonim which Feinstein found theologically objectionable  were not in fact written by those rishonim, but rather inserted into the text by erring students. According to Rav Dovid Cohen of Brooklyn, Feinstein attributed such comments to students as a way of politely rejecting statements by rishonim while still retaining full reverence for them as religious leaders of earlier generations.

43,"Moshe Pesach (Greek: Μωυσής Πεσάχ or Πέσαχ; 1869 – 13 November 1955) was a Greek rabbi who was the rabbi of Volos from 1892 until his death, and chief rabbi of Greece from 1946. Through his efforts, and with the assistance of the Greek authorities, the majority of the city's Jewish community was saved during the Holocaust.


== Life ==
Moshe Pesach was born in Larissa in 1869, and studied Jewish literature and philosophy at Thessaloniki. From 1892 he was active in the Jewish community of Volos as a rabbi. In the early 20th century, the city of Volos had a vibrant Jewish community: a population of c. 500 in 1896 rose to c. 2,000 in 1930, before falling drastically to 882 members in 1940, due to emigration to the large cities of Thessaloniki and Athens or abroad. In 1939, he was awarded the Gold Cross of the Order of the Phoenix by King George II of Greece.
Following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, Pesach was active in the underground network helping stranded Allied servicemen escape occupied Greece to the Middle East. During the early years of the Occupation, Volos was controlled by the Italian army. In 1943, as the Germans began to deport the Jews in their zone of occupation in Thessaloniki and Macedonia, the city received refugees, and many Jews of Volos began to flee the city to Athens or the surrounding countryside. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, the Germans took over the city. On 30 September, the German commandant, Kurt Rikert, summoned Pesach to his office and demanded a list of all Jews and their property within 24 hours, ostensibly for the purpose of determining food rations. Suspecting the Germans' real motives, Pesach managed to secure an extension of the deadline to three days, and immediately contacted the local Greek authorities: the mayor, chief of police, and the bishop of Demetrias, Joachim Alexopoulos. The latter contacted the local German consul, Helmut Scheffel, with whom he was befriended, and who confirmed that the Jews should leave as soon as possible. Provided with false identity papers and with a letter from the bishop to the local clergy to assist however possible, about 700 of the city's Jews dispersed in the countryside, where several joined the partisans. About 130 Jews, mostly those without means, remained behind. They were rounded up by the Germans on 24–25 March 1944 and sent to the death camps. 117 Jews from Volos were killed in the camps, 12 were executed there, and about 30 died of privations and starvation, but Pesach's actions saved 74% of the Jewish citizens of Volos, the second highest percentage in Greece after Zakynthos (where the entire Jewish community survived). Pesach himself survived among the partisans in the mountains, but his wife died from the privations, and his two sons, who taught Judaism in Thessaloniki and Didymoteicho, were captured and executed by the Germans.
After liberation, Pesach returned to Volos, becoming chief rabbi of Greece in 1946. He was honoured by the Allied Middle East Headquarters with a diploma, and in 1952, King Paul of Greece decorated him with the Order of George I. In April 1955, Volos was hit by a devastating earthquake. The aged rabbi was forced to live in a tent, later forfeiting his house in order to build a new synagogue in the same spot. He died on 13 November 1955. In 1957, the remains of Pesach and his wife Sara were brought to Jerusalem and interred next to Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel. His extensive library was transferred to the Ben-Zvi Institute.
On 16 April 2015, Pesach's role was commemorated at a special ceremony by B'nai B'rith and the Jewish National Fund at the Forest of the Martyrs in Jerusalem.

44,"Theodore Tuvia Zvi Friedman (January 11, 1908 – December 18, 1992) was an American and Israeli conservative rabbi, spiritual leader, and author. From 1962 to 1964, he served as the president of The Rabbinical Assembly, the international association of Conservative rabbis. During his tenure, he supported the African-American Civil Rights Movement.


== Biography ==
Born in Stamford, Connecticut, United States, on January 11, 1908, to Chaim Zvi Harry (Wilkemerski) and Anna Kapit (Kapetulsky) Friedman. His parents immigrated to the United States from Lithuania (father) and from Russia (mother).
He graduated from the City College of New York (1929). In 1931 he was ordained a rabbi by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he served as an associate professor. He earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1952.
Friedman served the Beit El Congregation in northern Bergen, New Jersey (1931–1942), Beit David Congregation in Buffalo, N.Y (1942–1944), the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City (1944–1954), where he founded a Hebrew high school. In 1954 Friedman became rabbi of Congregation Beth El, South Orange, New Jersey (1954–1970).
Friedman was an authority in Jewish education and a member of the Board of Governors of the National Academy of Adult Jewish Studies; he organized an innovative adult education program at Beth El based on a four-year curriculum that he designed.
Friedman also chaired the Rabbinical Assembly's Hebrew Culture Committee (1944–46) and was President of the Long Island Region of the Rabbinical Assembly (1947).
In 1948 he presented to the Rabbinical Assembly's annual convention, ""Towards a Philosophy of Conservative Judaism"", one of the key position papers, which led to the reorganization of the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law into the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly (CJLS). Here he effectively argued for going beyond Halakha in addressing the many problems of Jewish life.
Friedman chaired the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards from 1951 until 1954 and wrote many decisions, including on family issues, divorce, and Agunah. Friedman co-chaired the Steering Committee and was secretary of its national Bet Din. As Vice-president of the Rabbinical Assembly (1960–62), he led the committee that revised its constitution.
Friedman headed The Rabbinical Assembly as president from 1962 until 1964.
In addition to his work on behalf of the Rabbinical Assembly, he taught homiletics at the Seminary and was a member of the Jewish Book Council of America.
Friedman taught at the Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano (Latin American Rabbinical Seminary, also known as the Marshall T. Meyer Latin American Rabbinical Seminary, named for Friedman's son-in-law rabbi Marshall Meyer), a Jewish religious, cultural, and academic center in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
In 1970 Friedman immigrated to Israel upon his retirement from the active rabbinate. Following his retirement in 1970, he was elected Rabbi Emeritus of Congregation Beth El, South Orange. Since his aliya, he held a leadership role in the Israeli branch of the Rabbinical Assembly. Friedman taught at the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies and was its first head of Va'ad Halakhah, founded in 1985 by the Rabbinical Assembly of Israel. The Va'ad Halakhah addressed halakhic questions from Israel and Europe in Hebrew.
From 1970 to 1973, Friedman served on the Executive Council of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem.
Friedman died in Jerusalem, where he lived, on December 18, 1992.


=== Activities, attitudes, and spiritual perception ===
Friedman played a leading role in guiding the Rabbinical Assembly as it expanded in new directions in post-World War II.
Rabbi Friedman presided over the Rabbinical Assembly when it took the most significant social action stand in its history.
During his tenure as President of the Rabbinical Assembly, he supported the African-American Civil Rights Movement.
While the Rabbinical Assembly convention was in session in May 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. led demonstrations against police brutality in Birmingham, Alabama. During the convention, the call was sounded that a group of rabbis should go to Birmingham as representatives of the Rabbinical Assembly and demonstrate solidarity with the cause. At an earlier session on the second day of that convention, the question was raised about how spiritual leaders could be concerned only with Nazi cruelty when acts of injustice to fellow human beings were taking place in the USA.
Rabbi Friedman was among the decision-maker that sent a delegation of 19 rabbis to protest against police violence in Birmingham, Alabama.
In presenting the resolution to send a delegation, Rabbi Friedman stressed that their presence was ""urgent and of great importance."" After the vote endorsing the resolution, Rabbi Friedman noted: ""You go not only with our official endorsement to speak and act in our name, but you go with our heartfelt blessings and prayers. I want you to go feeling that we have not merely passed a resolution. You are our shlihim. We want you to go in that spirit..."".
As the Rabbinical Assembly's president, he worked to build bridges with the other Jewish denominations. He called upon his fellow rabbis to speak from their pulpits to encourage their congregants to embrace the causes of civil rights and Soviet Jewry. Friedman was one of the pioneering supporters of the Soviet Jewry Movement.
Rabbi Friedman opposed the definition of Judaism as racist by its very nature. His view was that the belief in a single God brought the idea of universality to the world. In his opinion, despite the harsh statements in Jewish sources against Idolatry, it should be interpreted in their historical context.
His spiritual approach was that while commitment and loyalty to the Halakha are beyond doubt, the Halakha should be interpreted, as it has always been interpreted, given the social, economic, and moral conditions prevailing at the time and the need and ability to meet the needs of the hour while remaining faithful to its sources.
As a member of the CJLS, Rabbi Friedman collaborated with Morris Adler and Jacob B. Agus to allow the use of electricity on Shabbat. He also allowed community members to ride to the synagogue on Shabbat with the intention of fulfilling the Shabbat mitzvot. The reasoning was that many American Jews were now living far from synagogues as an unavoidable consequence of modern life. Unless Jews were permitted to drive to synagogue, most American Jews would lose their connection to Jewish life. His position was adopted by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.
Rabbi Friedman was part of efforts by the Jewish Seminary to solve the long-standing crisis of the Agunah, a woman deserted by her husband and prohibited by Jewish law from remarriage. This led to the establishment of a Joint Law Conference of the Rabbinical Assembly and the Seminary as the Conservative movement's sole authority for adjudicating matters involving the Jewish laws of marriage and divorce.
Rabbi Friedman was concerned by attempts of extremist religious elements to polarize the American Jewish community into two opposing groups – religious and secularist – and their claim that they and they alone represent the Jewish religious community. He was also concerned by possible legislation in Israel that would abridge religious freedom in Israel. He led a fight against the Israeli Rabbinate to recognize Jewish religious divorces granted by American Conservative rabbis. As part of that struggle, the Rabbinical Assembly engaged Gideon Hausner, Israel's former Attorney General, to represent Israel on the issue.
Friedman believed that anyone who claims that it is forbidden to return any part of ""Eretz Yisrael hashleimah"" [""the complete land of Israel""] has no basis in the Halakha and that the controversy over the question of the Greater Land of Israel is a political conflict and there is no connection between the controversy and the Halakha. He conclusively showed that there is no such concept of the whole land of Israel in Jewish tradition because Israel's borders changed countless times throughout Jewish history, both in theory and in practice.
Friedman believed that conversion for marriage is valid, and the acceptance of the Yoke of the Mitzvot should not be a requirement where there is a fear that the converted will not keep all the mitzvot.
He believed that the establishment of the State of Israel was a great salvation for the Jewish people and a decisive turning point in history of the Jewish people. Therefore, the mourning customs should be shortened on Tisha B'Av by not completing the fast and ending with a great Mincha.
Friedman also believed that according to the Halakha, it is permissible to extradite a Jewish murderer abroad and that the best Halakhic scholars in all generations have ruled that if a criminal caused damage and sorrow to rabbis from Israel, he must be extradited.


=== Writings ===
Friedman was a member of the editorial board of the Conservative Judaism journal, which dealt with Jewish thought and was published by The Rabbinical Assembly and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, between 1953 and 1961, where he published some of his articles. Conservative Judaism was one of the earliest attempts to articulate the Jewish Conservative movement's theology.
Friedman was co-editor, with Robert Gordis, of Jewish Life in America (1955), an expansion of the special issue Judaism published in 1954 to celebrate the tercentenary of American Jewry. He wrote a column called ""Letters to Jewish College Students"" (1965), which discusses issues of Judaism and the modern life of college students. After immigrating to Israel, he wrote a column called ""Letter from Jerusalem,"" published in Conservative Judaism.
Friedman was an editor of Encyclopedia Judaica.
During his lifetime, he published over 200 articles in English, Hebrew and Spanish.


=== Books ===
Friedman authored the following books:

Judgment and Destiny (1965), a selection of his sermons published to mark the tenth anniversary of his rabbinate at Beth El.
The Rabbis' Bible: Later Prophets (with Solomon Simon and Abraham Rothberg).
Jewish Life in America
Letters to Jewish College Students


=== Personal life ===
In 1931 Friedman married Ruth Braunhut (1910 – 1973) and had three children: rabbi Hillel Friedman, Naomi Meyer, and Judy Rotem. His son-in-law, rabbi Marshall Meyer, was a leading American Conservative rabbi who was also known for his human rights activities during the ""Dirty War"" in Argentina (1976–1983). After the restoration of democracy in Argentina in 1983, Meyer was awarded Argentina's highest honor, the Order of the Liberator General San Martín, by the new president. His other son-in-law was rabbi David Joseph Spritzer, a Conservative rabbi who was one of the founders of the Hod Ve Hadar congregation in Kfar Saba, Israel. His grandson, Gabriel Meir Halevi, is a musician, peace activist and master of ceremonies and multicultural workshops. His granddaughter Rachel D. Friedman is a Professor and Chair of Greek and Roman Studies at Vassar College. His granddaughter Dodi Meyer is a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Medical Center.

45,"Eric H. Yoffie is a Reform rabbi, and President Emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ), the congregational arm of the Reform movement in North America, which represents an estimated 1.5 million Reform Jews in more than 900 synagogues across the United States and Canada. He was the unchallenged head of American Judaism's largest denomination from 1996 to 2012. Following his retirement in 2012, he has been a lecturer and writer; his writings appear regularly in The Huffington Post, The Jerusalem Post, and Haaretz.


== Family and career ==
Rabbi Yoffie was raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, where his family belonged to historic Temple Emanuel, and he was involved in the Reform Movement's Youth organization, the North American Federation of Temple Youth (NFTY). He first held the position of president in the Northeast Region of NFTY before moving on to be the organization's Vice President in 1965–1966.
After high school Yoffie spent his first year at Stanford University, and graduated from Brandeis University. He received his Rabbinical ordination from Hebrew Union College in New York in 1974. He served congregations in Lynbrook, NY, and Durham, NC, before joining the URJ as director of the Midwest Council in 1980. In 1983 he was named Executive Director of the Association of Reform Zionists of America (ARZA). In 1992 he became vice president of the URJ and director of the Commission on Social Action. In addition, he served as executive editor of the Reform Judaism magazine. On July 1, 1996, he succeeded Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler as president of the Union for Reform Judaism. In 1999 The Jewish Daily Forward named Yoffie the number one Jewish leader in America.
In 2009 Newsweek named him # 8 on its list of ""50 Influential Rabbis.""
He is married to Amy Jacobson Yoffie. The couple has two children, and reside in Westfield, New Jersey.
On June 10, 2010, Rabbi Yoffie announced his intention to step down from the post of president of the URJ at the age of 65, in June 2012. He was succeeded by Rabbi Rick Jacobs, who had served as the senior rabbi at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale, NY.


== Views on Jewish life ==
Rabbi Yoffie has been a proponent of increased traditionalism within Reform Judaism, encouraging a greater focus on Jewish text study and prayer. Dr. Jonathan Sarna, the dean of American Jewish historians, noted that Yoffie devoted time as President of the URJ to bringing ""old ideas"" to Reform Judaism, ""urging its rank and file to focus on enriching their spiritual lives and expanding their knowledge of Judaism."" During his tenure, he announced two major worship initiatives.  The first, in 1999, was designed to help congregations become ""houses in which we pray with joy."" The second, eight years later, fostered Shabbat observance among individual Reform Jews while encouraging congregations to rethink their Shabbat morning worship. Rabbi Yoffie was also a proponent of lifelong Jewish study and helped synagogues to develop programs that increased Jewish literacy among adults. In 2005, he introduced the Sacred Choices curriculum to teach sexual ethics to teens in Reform camps and congregations.
In his recent writings, Yoffie has argued against understandings of Judaism that are primarily secular or cultural, referring to such Jews as ""self-delusional,"" and suggesting that such understandings mistake a part for the whole and that a religiously-grounded Judaism is essential to assure the Jewish future.


== Views on interfaith relations ==
Rabbi Yoffie has been a pioneer in interfaith relations and launched Movement-wide dialogue programs with both Christians and Muslims. In 2005, he was the first Jew to address the Churchwide Assembly of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Later that year, he harshly criticized some positions of the Religious Right, but in 2006 he accepted the invitation of the Rev. Jerry Falwell to address the students and faculty of Liberty University; as the first Rabbi to appear at a university-wide convocation, he talked frankly of areas of agreement and disagreement between Evangelical Christians and Jews. Yoffie first spoke on shared values of family and morality before defending church-state separation and gay marriage, which elicited boos from the students.
On August 21, 2007, Rabbi Yoffie was the first leader of a major Jewish organization to speak at the convention of the Islamic Society of North America. In his remarks he spoke of ""a huge and profound ignorance of Islam"" by Jews and Christians in North America. He stated that ""the time has come to listen to our Muslim neighbors speak, from their heart and in their own words, about the spiritual power of Islam and their love for their religion.""  He also asked Muslims for more understanding of Judaism: “The dialogue will not be one way, of course. You will teach us about Islam and we will teach you about Judaism.  We will help you to overcome stereotyping of Muslims, and you will help us to overcome stereotyping of Jews.” Rabbi Yoffie later was a supporter of the Park51 Community Center, and he has been a strong advocate for the rights of Muslim Americans.
In contrast to these above interfaith efforts, Yoffie strongly disagrees with atheism, claiming that it lacks ""humility, imagination, and curiosity.""


== Views on social justice ==
As President of the URJ, Rabbi Yoffie spoke to a wide variety of social justice issues. He opposed the death penalty, supported LBGT rights, and was a prominent spokesperson for gun control. He was the only religious leader to appear at the Million Mom March in Washington, D.C., declaring that ""the indiscriminate distribution of guns is an offense against God and humanity."" Rabbi Yoffie went on to state that ""our gun-flooded society has turned weapons into idols, and the worship of idols must be recognized for what it is—blasphemy. And the only appropriate religious response to blasphemy is sustained moral outrage.""


== Views on relations with Israel ==
Rabbi Yoffie has devoted much of his public life to working on behalf of the Jewish state and promoting close ties between Israel and American Jews. During his years as URJ President, he met frequently with Israel's elected officials to present the concerns of the Reform movement and North American Jewry. He has been a prominent advocate of religious freedom and religious pluralism in Israel, arguing that the cause of Judaism can only be advanced by education and persuasion and not by coercion. In an incident that drew international headlines, Rabbi Yoffie in June 2006 declined to meet with Israeli President Moshe Katsav after Katsav refused to address Rabbi Yoffie with the title ""rabbi"". The Chief Rabbinate of Israel does not recognize rabbinic ordinations from non-Orthodox institutions. In 2014, Rabbi Yoffie challenged the presidential candidate Reuven Rivlin by asking if he would address Reform rabbis by the title ""rabbi."" While Rivlin did not respond directly to this issue while a candidate, a source close to him responded that he ""has always received Rabbi Yoffie respectfully and will continue to have a wonderful relationship with Diaspora Jews.""


== Contemporary spirituality ==
In his recent writings, in the Huffington Post and elsewhere, Rabbi Yoffie has addressed broad questions of belief and spirituality in American life. In particular, he has applied a progressive religious point of view to issues of sin, atheism, and community, as well as contemporary matters such as immigration, health care, and economic justice. In ""What it Means to be a Liberal Person of Faith"" and in other widely read articles, he has suggested that progressive religion has a vital role to play during a time of ""culture wars,"" fear of terrorism, and economic uncertainty.

47,"Jacob Shmuel Boteach (born November 19, 1966), known as Shmuley Boteach, is an American rabbi, author, and media host.
He hosted two seasons of the reality television series Shalom in the Home on TLC.
Newsweek named him one of the 10 most influential rabbis in the United States, and The Jerusalem Post named him one of the 50 most influential Jews in the world.


== Early and personal life ==
Boteach was born in Los Angeles, California, the youngest of five children; he also spent part of his early years in Miami, Florida. His father Yoav Botach (1932–2020) was an Iranian Jew who left Isfahan with his family of 13 to settle in Israel. His mother Eleanor (1942–2023) was an American Jew who met his father in Beersheba, Israel, where she was visiting as a tourist. Shortly after their marriage, the couple relocated with their children to New York and then to Los Angeles. Boteach's parents divorced when he was eight years old; on his bar mitzvah, he told his parents that he wanted them to reunite.
In 1977, he joined the Miami Boys Choir (then known as the Miami Choir Boys). His most notable solo was in the hit song 'Boruch Hashem' in 1979.
Boteach attended a Chabad (Lubavitch) camp, and fell in love with Judaism. The Lubavitcher Rebbe became his patron, and at age 13 Boteach joined the Chabad movement (a Hasidic philosophy that traces back 250 years to Lubavitch, Russia). At age 14, he decided he wanted to become a rabbi, to help heartbroken people. He studied at Rabbi Alexander S. Gross Hebrew Academy and at a series of yeshivas in Los Angeles, New York, and Jerusalem, Israel (for three years at Torat Emet Yeshiva).
Boteach was ultimately chosen to be one of ten Chabad students sent to Sydney, Australia, to start a yeshiva. In Sydney he met the parents of his future wife, Debbie. Boteach met her when he was 21 years old, and they married in Sydney in 1988. He then returned to New York, and took semicha (rabbinical ordination) in 1988.
By 2019, Boteach and his Australian wife Debbie had nine children; six of them were born in England. They resided in Englewood, New Jersey.


== Rabbinical career ==
In 1988, Boteach was sent at age 22 by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, as a Chabad-Lubavitch shaliach (emissary) to Oxford, England, where he served as rabbi to Oxford University's students for 11 years. During that time, he founded the Oxford University L'Chaim Society (in Hebrew, L'Chaim means ""To Life""). The society grew to be the second-biggest student organization ever in Oxford, with a membership that included over 5,000 non-Jews. It attracted star speakers from politics, arts, and culture, including six Israeli prime ministers, former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke, former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, singer Boy George, football player Diego Maradona, and actor Jon Voight.
The society's members included Cory Booker, Maurizio Giuliano, Michael Benson and Eric Garcetti Some Orthodox patrons became concerned about the percentage of non-Jewish members, and after Schneerson died in 1994, Chabad UK leadership asked Boteach to remove non-Jewish students from the society; others wanted Boteach to exclude gay students. Boteach refused on both counts, saying the Rebbe had loved non-Jews and regularly reached out to them; Boteach then changed the L'Chaim Society from a student society into an independent organization.
Later in 1994, after Boteach refused to cancel a speaking event featuring Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, he and Chabad split over the issue. Lubavitch leadership objected to the Prime Minister speaking, because Schneerson before he died had opposed Rabin's peace deal proposal. After Boteach defied the suspension order, he was summoned to attend a beth din hearing at the Lubavitch World Headquarters. Boteach later confirmed that he was involuntarily terminated by Chabad—but said he still loved Chabad, and was raising his children in the Chabad tradition.
Excerpts from his best seller Kosher Sex were serialized in Playboy in 1998.  Boteach at the time was the leader of Shabbat services at an Orthodox Willesden synagogue in north London, where attendance had more than doubled after his arrival. He resigned from his role at the synagogue. While he had received the support of England's Chief Rabbi, whose office issued a statement saying Boteach was an ""imaginative talent...  prepared to take risks in order to communicate an authentic Jewish message to a new generation,"" Boteach  wanted to ""spare Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks problems with his rabbinate and the London Beit Din"" according to media reports.
In 1999, the British government's Charity Commission raised concerns over payments made by the L'Chaim Society. In September, the Charity Commission temporarily froze the Society's bank accounts as a ""temporary and protective measure"", citing concerns about ""the application and control"" of the charity's funds—however, the Charity Commission released the funds three months later, in December. The Society had made payments on a north London home in which Boteach lived.  L'Chaim Society officials explained that the payments had been made only after the Society had consulted with and followed the legal advice of charity experts at a top London law firm. The rabbi said: ""This is a totally normal process in the United States."" In the immediate wake of the announcement, he was banned from speaking at the New West End Synagogue by Chief Rabbi Sacks. The Charity Commission later found no evidence of wrongdoing, but determined that the mortgage payments were ""difficult, if not impossible, to justify"" under British law. Boteach reportedly repaid the £150,000 to the trustees, and the issue was resolved with Boteach being cleared.
In 2000, Boteach won the ""Preacher of the Year"" Award, out of all faiths in Britain, from The Times in London.  The Jewish Chronicle described him as ""the United Kingdom's most high-profile rabbi"".  Boteach was listed in the top 10 on Newsweek's ""Top 50 Rabbis in America"" in 2007 (when it described him as ""the most famous rabbi in America""), ninth in 2008, seventh in 2009, and sixth in 2010.  The Washington Post referred to him as ""the most famous rabbi in America,"" and The Jerusalem Post named him one of the 50 most influential Jews in the world.
In 2013, Boteach was the commencement speaker for Southern Utah University, which granted him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.
Boteach has attracted both praise and criticism from fellow rabbis during his career. For example, after the release of his book Kosher Jesus, Rabbi Israel Zoberman wrote that Boteach ""offers a well-written scholarly volume that is far from dry and is accessible to all, one that both honors and is critical of [Christians and Jews],"" and Israeli-American Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews praised it as ""courageous and thought-provoking"". Similarly, Rabbi Michael Leo Samuel, while noting what Boteach could have added to his book to deepen it, concluded that it was a bold book and that he admired the courage of a Hassidic rabbi wishing: ""to talk about Jesus in a manner that is respectful and kind. This is quite a rarity—especially when you consider the animus that most Hassidic and Haredi Jews feel toward Jesus.... All in all I admire his ...  willingness to talk about a subject that has remained a forbidden topic of discussion in Jewish circles of all denominations... one can argue that Shmuley's Kosher Jesus should serve as a meaningful first step for many Jews wishing to promote a more truthful and meaningful dialogue with the Christian community."" But in contrast, 
Jacob Immanuel Schochet, a Canadian Orthodox Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi, was fiercely critical, deeming the book to be heretical and asserting that it ""poses a tremendous risk to the Jewish community,"" and saying that ""it is forbidden for anyone to buy or read this book,"" and it ""does more to enhance the evangelical missionary message"" than any other book. A Chicago Chabad rabbi—who admitted that he had only read the title of the book—wrote an op-ed in which he asserted on that basis alone that the book was apikorus (heresy) and must be treated as such. In reaction, Australian Orthodox Chabad Rabbi Moshe Gutnick, while agreeing with some of what Boteach said and disagreeing with other points, wrote: ""The suggestion that [Boteach] is a heretic is simply ludicrous"". Rabbi Michael Samuel of Temple Beth Sholom in Chula Vista, California, opined: ""Lubavitchers do not want to know anything about Jesus."" Boteach, for his part, said: ""We are the People of the Book. We aren't the people who ban books.""
Boteach is noted for his flamboyance and self-promotion. In an article in The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg referred to him as the ""Baal Shem Tov of self-promotion"". While promoting his book at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, explaining why he was there he said: ""God gave 10 commandments at Sinai, and the 11th commandment, which they expunged but which has come down orally, is 'Thou shalt do anything for publicity and recognition.'"" He later described the comment as merely a sarcastic remark.


== Media career ==
In 2006 and 2007, Boteach hosted the one-hour prime time television series Shalom in the Home. The series, which ran for two seasons on the TLC network, was a reality show in which Boteach counseled dysfunctional families and gave advice to struggling couples about their relationships and parenting. Shalom in the Home attracted almost 700,000 viewers per episode, and was one of the cable network's highest-rated shows. In 2007 he wrote a book with the same name, based on the TV series. That year, The National Fatherhood Initiative gave him its highest award for his efforts in the television series.  After the series ended, Boteach remained in contact with the families, counseling them, and having them over to his home. In 2022, the Jewish Journal named Boteach one of ""The Top 10 Jewish Reality TV Stars of All Time.""
In 2014, Boteach was featured in an episode of the Sundance Channel's Dream School reality television series. It was a non-fiction original series, which introduced troubled teen high school dropouts to mentors, in order to inspire the teenagers to turn their lives around.
On television, he has also made guest appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Dr. Phil Show, Larry King Live, Dateline NBC, The Today Show, The Howard Stern Show, The View, The O'Reilly Factor, The Dr. Oz Show and Piers Morgan Uncensored.
On radio, Boteach hosted a weekly nationally syndicated radio program on WABC called The Shmuley Show. It aired on Sunday evenings from 7-9 p.m. He was also host of his own daily talk radio show on the ""Oprah and Friends"" network on her XM radio channel.
Boteach has written syndicated columns for both The Huffington Post and The Jerusalem Post. He is also an op-ed contributor to The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and other newspapers.
In March 2000, Boteach entered into an agreement with MatchNet (the creator of online dating site Jdate) to become its spokesman for three years, for an annual salary and stock options. After its initial public offering, the company sought to renegotiate his contract at a lower salary. According to his lawsuit, when he refused to renegotiate his agreement he was terminated right before his stock options vested. He claimed that MatchNet hired him to add legitimacy to its public offering, but never intended to fulfill its promises.


=== Conflict with Candace Owens ===
In March 2024 Boteach engaged in a public feud with the conservative commentator Candace Owens over alleged antisemitic remarks and her support for Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war. In response to Owens's remarks, Boteach dressed up as a ""Candace Owens Jew"", invoking antisemitic stereotypes like blood libel and a hooknose for the Jewish holiday of Purim.


== Relationship with Michael Jackson ==
In the late 1990s, Boteach became a friend, close confidant, and unofficial spiritual advisor to singer Michael Jackson. Jackson and his children joined the Boteach family at their home on many Friday nights for Sabbath dinner, and Jackson  gave the family a dog as a present. Boteach was a vocal supporter of Jackson and was initially  ""dismissive of suggestions that Jackson's relationships with children have been anything other than wholesome. ""Why would anyone believe those charges? They said anyone who spends that amount of time with kids has to be sick. Well, that's not an indictment of Michael Jackson, that's an indictment of our society!"" He said further: ""I was friendly with Michael for a year before anyone knew about it. I did my own investigation. He never had sex with the child he made the settlement with, and there are no others.""
Boteach served as president for the Heal the Kids offshoot (established by Boteach and Jackson in 2000) of the Heal the World Foundation charity founded by Jackson to encourage parents to spend more time with their children, and to help children threatened by war and disease by providing them with medicine and food. Jackson said: ""Our goal is simple: to recreate the parent-child bond, renew its promise, and light the way forward for all the beautiful children who are destined one day to walk this earth."" Heal the Kids was linked to the L'Chaim Society. Gossip blogger Roger Friedman claimed that donations to Heal the Kids were actually going to L’Chaim Society, and that Denise Rich who donated $100,000 by check to the L'Chaim Society was unaware that the funds would go to Boteach's organization; Rich declined to comment. Responding to the claims, Boteach accused Friedman, who was fired from Fox News in 2009, of holding a bias against Jackson, and having poor journalism ethics, saying: ""Roger Friedman is the foremost Michael Jackson hater on planet earth. He was fired by Fox News for being an unscrupulous reporter.""
Boteach later disavowed his relationship with Jackson. The two had a falling-out in 2002, after Jackson did not stick to the recovery programs they had worked out, which included his waking up at a reasonable hour and not being alone with children other than Jackson's own kids, and after Jackson's second arrest on charges of sexually abusing a child. Jackson reportedly kept an ""enemy list"" after their relationship ended on which Boteach appeared, along with Uri Geller, Gloria Allred, Tommy Mottola, Tom Sneddon, and Janet Arvizo.
After Jackson died of acute propofol intoxication in 2009, Boteach published The Michael Jackson Tapes. The book was drawn from 30 hours of interviews Boteach had with Jackson that were taped with Jackson's approval, and that Jackson intended to be for a book. In the tapes, Jackson spoke of his childhood scars and demanding father, the price of fame, his friendships with Madonna and Brooke Shields, married life, his relationship with children, his shyness, his fear of growing old, spirituality, and racism. Boteach wrote in the prologue: ""This book is being published because it was Michael Jackson's desperate wish that it be so"". Vibe wrote: ""It's perhaps Michael's most lucid look at the man in the mirror,"" and The San Diego Tribune wrote: ""The Michael Jackson Tapes breaks little in the way of new ground but the book ... provides firsthand detail about the performer's excesses and obsessions."" At the same time, the publication was criticized by Nathan Rabin, writing for The A.V. Club, who opined that the book was the ""worst kind of posthumous cash-in"". Boteach published a second related book in 2010, entitled: Honoring the Child Spirit: Inspiration and Learning from Our Children, in conversation with Michael Jackson.


== The World Values Network and Zionist activism ==
Boteach is the founder and executive director of The World Values Network (also known as ""This World: The Values Network""), a Jewish and Zionist non-profit organization that he established in 2007. The mission of the organization is to ""disseminate universal Jewish values in politics, culture, and media"". The organization is founded on the belief that Judaism, with its emphasis on perfecting the world and celebrating life, can help America address some of its greatest challenges, such as  high  divorce rates, teenager alienation, depression, and increasing ignorance and materialism.
The organization holds an annual Champions of Jewish Values International Awards gala. The gala has honored figures across the fields of politics, business, journalism and entertainment who have promoted Israel and Jewish values.
The organization collects donations and has funded newspaper advertisements about anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. It has placed ads condemning celebrities that criticize Israel or support Palestinians including Lorde, Natalie Portman, Dua Lipa, Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid, Secretary of State John Kerry's work towards the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar for her Anti-Zionist remarks.
In 2015, US National Security Advisor Susan Rice criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for agreeing to speak to Congress about Iran's nuclear program without coordinating with the Obama administration. The World Values Network placed an ad in The New York Times in response that read ""Susan Rice has a blind spot: Genocide"", and said that her action had ""injected a degree of partisanship"" that is ""destructive of the fabric of the relationship"" between the US and Israel. The ad faced widespread criticism by Jewish organizations. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) criticized the ad, stating ""there is no justification for this incendiary personal attack."" In an article for The Washington Post, rabbi Jill Jacobs also criticized Boteach for the ad and labeling himself ""America's rabbi,"" as no such position exists. Jacobs wrote ""Rabbi Boteach may claim to be America’s rabbi. But America’s real rabbis are the ones who reject cowardly attacks and take the risk of standing up for the rights of all people."" After continued backlash, Boteach apologized, saying that the disagreement was over policy, and he did not intend to make a personal attack. Speaking to CNN, he said the purpose of the ad was to bring attention to his perception that the United States government has ignored genocides in the past, and continues to do so.
In 2018, New Zealander singer Lorde cancelled a Tel Aviv concert in support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. The World Values Network placed an ad in response, calling her a ""bigot"". The criticism was one of several denunciations from well-known Israelis and Zionist leaders of her cancellation, and the Zionist Federation of New Zealand and the Jewish Council of New Zealand were also critical of her, though the ad itself was met with a distancing by the council.
On May 23, 2021, the organization ran a full-page New York Times ad calling on Dua Lipa, and Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid, to condemn Hamas, claiming the group ""calls for a second Holocaust."" Lipa and the Hadids' comments came after reporting by Human Rights Watch and B'Tselem. Boteach wrote that Lipa and Bella Hadid accused Israel of ""ethnic cleansing, even as millions of Jews in Israel descend from Holocaust survivors, refugees savagely forced out of every Arab land and Jews living in pre-state Israel who were subjected to multiple Arab massacres and pogroms,"" and accused them of anti-Semitism for having ""vilified the Jewish state"". He called for them to consider condemning Hamas instead of Israel, for its brutality toward women, tolerance for honor killings of young Palestinian girls, use of children as human shields for military stockpiles and rocket launch-pads, murders of LGBTQ Palestinians, and avoidance of fair elections ""after fourteen autocratic years."" Lipa rejected what she characterized as ""the false and appalling allegations"" and said that WVN used her name ""shamelessly"" to ""advance their ugly campaign with falsehoods and blatant misrepresentations.""
The New York Daily News reported on the organization's tax filing in 2009, two years after the organization's founding, and noted that it raised $651,000, and paid $638,000 in operating and administrative expenses combined (including a $229,000 salary for Boteach—up from $59,000 the prior year, and $70,000 in charitable disbursements). The organization paid Boteach a director salary of $330,371 in 2015. In 2018, Charity Navigator, a charity assessment organization that evaluates charitable organizations in the United States, evaluated the stability, efficiency, sustainability, accountability, and transparency policies of World Values Network to measure the charity's good governance and integrity, and gave World Values Network a score of 100 out of 100. At the time World Values Network had $1.3 million in total revenue, 76.11% of its revenue in 2016-18 was spent on program expenses (for a passing score, Charity Navigator looks for a ratio of 70% or more), only 22.9% on administrative expenses (Charity Navigator looks for administrative expenses to be under 30%), three of its four board of director members were independent (Charity Navigator looks for at least 50% independent directors), and it had an annual independent audit.


== Views ==


=== Marriage ===
In his 2014 book Kosher Lust, Boteach said that lust, rather than love, is the glue to a healthy marriage. The book's subtitle is ""Love is not the Answer"". He believes married couples should focus on having a strong sexual connection. Boteach writes of three ""pillars of lust"" that he believes ensure an exciting marriage: unavailability (""Eros thrives in the shadows""), mystery (keeping some things private), and sinfulness (being novel and risqué in couples' sex lives; ""anything that makes you more hooked"" is permissible in the bedroom). He expands upon his view, saying that the essence of lust is desire. ""I want you; I can't live without you; my life is empty without you; I will forsake everything for you — the intensity, that passion. And I don't just mean physical lust, like lust for the body, because that wanes... I mean the natural gravitation of two energies — masculine to feminine, feminine to masculine."" He also opines that of course one needs ""respect, appreciation, compliments, shared values."" But says that if one is in a marriage where one doesn't deeply desire the other person, ""you are in a jail cell. It's a form of incarceration.""
He also says that the essence of lust and desire is ""chosen,"" and that a woman - in particular - wants to feel chosen.  He in addition is of the view that when men don't speak to their wives, which happens for a variety of reasons, that causes their wives to feel a great deal of pain.

As to underpinnings of his views in Judaism, Boteach opines that all of the notable marriages in the Bible are lust relationships, rather than love relationships. He points out that Jacob waits seven years for Rachel but for Jacob it feels like just a few days, and that the first thing Rebecca does when she meets Isaac is put a veil over her face.”
He also points to the Bible's Song of Solomon, a poem that describes the yearning of a man for a woman: ""Your breasts are like two fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse among the lilies... Your stature is like that of the palm, and your breasts like clusters of fruit. I said, 'I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit'.""  He wrote that it is part of Jewish Talmudic law that a man must ensure that his wife reaches orgasm before he does.


=== Sexuality ===
Boteach's book Kosher Sex: A Recipe for Passion and Intimacy (1999) was a best seller. The Washington Post referred to him as ""Dr. Ruth with a yarmulke,"" and the British media called the book the ""kosher Kamasutra"". His philosophy is that ""passionate lovemaking ... leads to intimacy"" and  is the foundation of a relationship. He opined: ""Only sex has the capacity to bring in its wake an overwhelming tidal wave of positive emotion which makes us feel intensely good about each other ... which conversation can't do, which friendship can't do, which shared experiences can't do."" He is also of the view that while one does not have to be religious to love sex, it helps, and while one does not have to be married to have great sex, it helps. He opined: ""Couples should have the dirtiest sex where they can't control themselves, where the beast within is awakened. That's what passion is all about. In order to have that, you need a modest exterior. That is eroticism."" To achieve that, he is in favor of anything that fans the spark between a married couple, including (when he is asked) oral sex and sex toys. At the same time, because he believes they distract or dull one's sexual edge, he is against the lights being on and masturbation. He is also of the view that we should refrain from sex before marriage, because it's bad sex.
Backstage at The Today Show, he ran into former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who asked for a signed copy of the book.  At the same time, the book caused a stir in the Orthodox community—even so, in the summer of 2012 it was the most checked-out non-fiction book in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, which houses the center for Chabad Jewry in America.

One of the rabbi's daughters, Chana Boteach, followed up on her father's theme years later. In 2019 when she was 28 years old she opened a boutique Kosher Sex shop in Tel Aviv (subsequently, she opened one in Jerusalem), and also began selling its products online.


==== Homosexuality ====
Boteach wrote in a 2010 Wall Street Journal op-ed column on homosexuality that he does not deny that there is a biblical prohibition on male same-sex relationships, and a commandment for men and women to marry and have children. Still, he understands those in context. ""There are 613 commandments in the Torah... So when Jewish gay couples tell me they have never been attracted to members of the opposite sex and are desperate alone, I tell them ""You have 611 commandments left. That should keep you busy. Now, go create a kosher home ... you are His beloved children."" Five years later he wrote that he believed in the equality of all of God's children, and has seen too much homophobia in his life.  He believes that the biggest threat to marriage doesn't come from gay marriage, but heterosexual divorce, which he says afflicts half of marriages. He opposes government involvement at all in recognizing marriage, but supports state-sanctioned civil unions for all.


=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Speaking about the COVID-19 pandemic, Boteach said ""I utterly reject and find it sickening when people believe that this is some kind of punishment from God - that really upsets me."" He also said that he found it: ""very upsetting when religious leaders don't shut down their synagogues, churches, or mosques because they believe that prayer is more important than preserving life."" At the same time, as his father died during the pandemic and his brother became sick with COVID-19, he wrote about the difficulty of dealing with those tragedies during the pandemic.


=== Outreach to non-Jews ===
In 2008, he debated Douglas Jacoby and Shabir Ally, on The True Legacy of Abraham, and the next year he debated Douglas Jacoby on ""Judaism & Christianity: Which is the Religion of Peace?"" In 2008, he debated Michael Brown, a leader of the Messianic Jews, on whether belief in Jesus is compatible with Judaism, and in his book Kosher Jesus he depicts Jesus as ""a Jewish patriot murdered by Rome for his struggle on behalf of his people."" These positions drew opposition from Yitzchak Schochet, a British rabbi who was a rival of Boteach's, who called Boteach's attempts to reach out to Messianic Jews ""self-delusional"".  Boteach is also of the view that while the Chabad movement's objective is to serve all Jews, its philosophy also extends to helping others become stronger in their respective religions.


=== Jesus and Christianity ===
In his 2012 book Kosher Jesus, Boteach takes the position that Jesus was a wise and learned Torah-observant rabbi, and a beloved member of the Jewish community. At the same time, he writes Jesus despised the Romans for their cruelty, and fought them courageously. He states that the Jews had nothing whatsoever to do with the murder of Jesus, but rather that blame for his trial and killing lies with the Romans and Pontius Pilate. Boteach states that he does not believe in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah. At the same time, Boteach argues that ""Jews have much to learn from Jesus — and from Christianity as a whole — without accepting Jesus' divinity. There are many reasons for accepting Jesus as a man of great wisdom, beautiful ethical teachings, and profound Jewish patriotism.""  He concludes by writing, as to Judeo-Christian values, that ""the hyphen between Jewish and Christian values is Jesus himself.""


==== Presbyterian Church ====
In a June 2014 column for the Jerusalem Post, Boteach heavily criticized the US Presbyterian Church after it voted to divest from three American companies (Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard, and Motorola Solutions) doing business in Israel. The Church described the divestment as ""a last resort, as a matter of faithful stewardship, when it becomes apparent that an investment can no longer be part of a constructive partnership for good. Presbyterians believe firmly that their investments must be in alignment with their values."" Boteach wrote in response, ""the rotting corpse of the Presbyterian Church got another nail in its coffin with the vote on Friday"" and ""the Church demonstrates that it has no moral compass.""


=== Israel–Palestine conflict ===
Boteach is a Zionist. He was critical of Obama-era American policy towards the country. Boteach argued that the Obama administration bullied Israel, and that U.S. Middle Eastern policy was ""scandalous"" and ""disgusting"". He is also supportive of Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories, which have been condemned as illegal by the United Nations, International Court of Justice, and the rest of the international community. Boteach described the Hebron settlement as ""warmth, friendliness and hospitality"" and ""liberated from hatred"". The community has received sustained criticism for maintaining a shrine to Baruch Goldstein, the mass murderer who perpetrated the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. It also serves as a pilgrimage site for extremists.
Boteach was supportive of President Donald Trump's Israel policies, and called him ""the most pro-Israel president in history"". Two of his children had served as soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces.


=== Infant circumcision ===
Boteach has argued in favor of infant male circumcision, defending the practice on religious grounds and health grounds, while contrasting it sharply with female circumcision. He said that to compare the excising of a male foreskin with the removal of a female clitoris is a lie, as ""female circumcision is all about removing a woman's ability to experience pleasure during sex, and is a barbarous act of mutilation that has no corollary to its male counterpart."" He said that ""Judaism celebrates the sexual, intimate and erotic bond between husband and wife, and attempts to portray circumcision as a method of denying a man's sexual pleasure are ignorant.""
He has also advocated for the medical benefits of male circumcision reducing the transmission and incidence of HIV-AIDS, other STDs such as genital herpes and syphilis, urinary-tract infections, penile cancer, and other adverse health conditions, pointing to a report in the British Medical Journal.
Discussing New Testament mention of male circumcision, Boteach noted that when Jesus is criticized for healing a crippled man on the Sabbath (John 5:1-47), Jesus quotes a legal precedent preserved later in the Talmud (Tractate Yoma) to prove that his action is justified, saying: ""Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man's whole body on the Sabbath?"" (7:23 NIV).
Boteach has written op-eds in The Wall Street Journal and the Huffington Post denouncing legislation to limit male circumcision.


=== Pornography ===
Boteach has been critical of pornography. In 2016, he co-authored a viral Wall Street Journal opinion piece with actress and former Playboy model Pamela Anderson, in which they called online pornography a ""public hazard of unprecedented seriousness"". Boteach observed: ""It can be intimidating to talk about pornography and eroticism alongside an international sex symbol, but I think Pamela has handled it extremely well."" The two also wrote a book together, Lust for Love (2018), about how meaningful, passionate sex has been declining, and calling for a new sensual revolution that emphasizes partners connecting in the bedroom. In 2001, he publicly debated pornography with  Jewish Playmate Lindsey Vuolo.


=== Racism ===
In November 2016, Boteach wrote a piece in The Hill defending Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon after his appointment to the White House was condemned by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).
In December 2022, in response to increasing instances of racism and antisemitism in the United States, Boteach, Reverends Al Sharpton and Conrad Tillard, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Carnegie Hall Chairman Robert F. Smith, and Elisha Wiesel joined to host 15 Days of Light, celebrating Hanukkah and Kwanzaa in a unifying holiday ceremony at Carnegie Hall.  Boteach said: ""This is the way it should be. Blacks and Jews united to promote human dignity and fight the haters.""


== 2012 Congressional elections ==
Boteach, a self-described social moderate, ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in northern New Jersey in the 2012 elections. He became the first rabbi ever to run for the U.S. Congress as a Republican, and had he won he would have been the first rabbi in Congress. Referring to the 50% divorce rate in the United States as ""an American tragedy that no one talks about,"" he supported making marriage and family counseling tax-deductible to help strengthen marriages and lower the nation's divorce rate. He also supported a federal school voucher system, lower taxes, a flat tax and simplification of the tax code, smaller government, and preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon. He was staunchly Zionist, and anti-terrorism and Hamas. He received the endorsement of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).
Boteach won the Republican primary for New Jersey's 9th congressional district seat in a three-way race on June 5. He received 57.9% of the vote, defeating Hector Castillo with 28.3% of the vote, and Blase Billack with 13.8% of the vote.
In the November general election he faced eight-term Democratic 8th District Representative and former mayor of Paterson, New Jersey, Bill Pascrell. Boteach gave a $250 donation to his opponent, because he wanted them to have a Friday night Shabbat dinner date together at his home to get to know each other as people before they were opponents, and he was hoping his donation would get Pascrell's attention after several unsuccessful attempts to arrange the dinner. Pascrell raised more money than any other congressional candidate in the state in 2012, $2.6 million, 10x what Boteach raised. Boteach lost in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 3-to-1, by a margin of 73.6% to 25.4%. In his concession speech Boteach said: ""He is now my Congressman. I pledge my complete support to him.""

49,"Simon Greenberg (1901 – July 26, 1993) was a Russian-born American Conservative rabbi and scholar. Greenberg was part of the senior management of many Jewish organizations in America. He helped to found a number of institutions, including the American Jewish University, of which he was the first President. At the time of his death, he was vice chancellor emeritus of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Greenberg has been called ""one of the most important leaders of the Conservative movement"".


== Life ==
Greenberg was born in Horoshen, Russia. At the age of 4, he moved to the United States with his family.
In 1922, Greenberg graduated from City College of New York having previously attended the University of Minnesota. He then began studying at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he was ordained a rabbi in 1925. Throughout his career, Greenberg was committed to both the academic and sacred spheres, often undertaking overlapping tasks. Thus 1925 marked Greenberg's ordination, his enrollment at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as part of its first class of students, and his appointment as rabbi of the Har Zion Temple in Philadelphia, a position he would hold until 1946. His responsibilities in Philadelphia included acting as an advisor to Jewish students at the nearby University of Pennsylvania and Temple University. In his final year in Philadelphia, he helped to co-found the Akiba Hebrew Academy.
In 1932, Greenberg was awarded his PhD from Dropsie College. He went on to join the faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary the same year. In 1950, he became executive director of the United Synagogue of America. The same year, at the organization's biennial conference, he was instrumental in persuading fellow attendees to call for the repeal of the McCarran Internal Security Act. Greenberg spoke against the Act, calling it a threat to civil liberties. Greenberg stepped down from his role as executive director in 1953.
In 1948, Greenberg was named acting president of Jewish Theological Seminary. In 1957, Greenberg became vice chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, a post he held until 1986. Thereafter, he was vice chancellor emeritus. In 1958, shortly after becoming vice chancellor, Greenberg co-founded the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University) in Los Angeles. He was the institute's first president, and stepped down down from the role in 1963 to become chairman of the executive committee of the Jewish Agency and the World Zionist Organization of America. He stepped down from that role in 1968.


== Personal life ==
Greenberg and his wife Betty were married for 67 years. They had two sons, Moshe Greenberg, a biblical scholar, and Daniel Greenberg. The couple had moved to Jerusalem from Manhattan approximately a year before Simon's death. His wife pre-deceased him by 4 months.


== Legacy ==
Greenberg has been called ""one of the most important leaders of the Conservative movement"". Every year, the Jewish Theological Seminary presents the Rabbi Simon Greenberg Award ""for outstanding devotion to klal Yisrael (the entire Jewish community) and to all humanity and for unswerving loyalty to JTS.""

50,"Sinai Simon Naschér (16 March 1841 – 25 July 1901) was a Hungarian Jewish religious leader and writer.


== Biography ==
Naschér was born to a rabbinic family in Liptó-Szent-Miklós, the son of Eva (née Simandel-Nicolauer) and Rabbi Moses Naschér. His paternal grandfather, Jonathan Nascher, served as rabbi of Bielitz, Austrian Silesia, while his maternal grandfather, Beer Simandel-Nicolauer, was a rabbi in Liptó-Szent-Miklós. Naschér was educated at the gymnasium in Baja as a student of József Kolmár. He later studied in Berlin, where he was ordained by the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums and received his Ph.D. from the University.
From 1866 he was a rabbi and preacher in Berlin, and delivered sermons at the Orthodox Schochare Hattob Congregation synagogue on Neue Friedrichstraße. He was, however, eventually forced to resign in 1880 on account of the deterioration of his mental health. From then on he lived in retirement at Baja.

51,"Stephen Samuel Wise (March 17, 1874 – April 19, 1949) was an early 20th-century American Reform rabbi and Zionist leader in the Progressive Era. Born in Budapest, he was an infant when his family immigrated to New York. He followed his father and grandfather in becoming a rabbi, serving in New York and in Portland, Oregon. Wise was also a founding member of the NAACP.


== Early life ==
Wise was born on March 17, 1874, in Budapest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the son and grandson of rabbis and their wives. His grandfather, Joseph Hirsch Weiss, was rabbi of Erlau, today known as Eger, and a highly conservative haredi scholar. Wise's father, Aaron Wise, earned a PhD and ordination in Europe. Wise's maternal grandfather, Móric Fischer de Farkasházy, created the Herend Porcelain Company. When Wise's father sought to unionize the company, Moric gave the family one-way tickets to New York.  In the U.S., Aaron Wise eventually became chief rabbi of the Congregation Rodeph Sholom in New York City, moving from his own father's Orthodoxy toward Reform Judaism.


=== Education ===
Stephen Wise attended local public schools. He received his higher education at the College of the City of New York, Columbia College (B.A. 1892, Cum laude), and Columbia University (PhD 1902). Later he pursued rabbinical studies under rabbis Richard J. H. Gottheil, Alexander Kohut, Gersoni, Joffe, and Margolis. He was ordained as rabbi by Rabbi Adolph Jellinek of Vienna in 1893. In 1933, Wise received an honorary L.H.D. from Bates College.


== Career ==
In 1893, Wise was appointed assistant rabbi of Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, Manhattan; its senior rabbi was Henry S. Jacobs. Later in the same year, Wise became the senior rabbi of the same congregation.
In 1900, he was called as rabbi to Congregation Beth Israel in Portland, Oregon.  Typical of the activists of the Progressive Era, he attacked ""many of the social and political ills of contemporary America."" In 1906, concerning another rabbinical appointment, Wise made a major break from the established Reform movement over the ""question whether the pulpit shall be free or whether the pulpit shall not be free, and, by reason of its loss of freedom, reft of its power for good""; in 1907 he established his Free Synagogue, starting the ""free Synagogue"" movement.
Wise was an early supporter of Zionism. His support for, and commitment to Political Zionism was atypical of Reform Judaism, which had been historically non-Zionist since it adopted the Pittsburgh Platform in 1885. He was a founder of the New York Federation of Zionist Societies in 1897, which led in the formation of the national Federation of American Zionists (FAZ), a forerunner of the Zionist Organization of America. At the Second Zionist Congress (Basel, 1898), Wise was a delegate and secretary for the English language. Wise served as honorary secretary of FAZ, in close cooperation with Theodor Herzl, until the latter's death in 1904.
In 1915, Wise was one of the founding members of the American Committee on Armenian Atrocities, which later became Near East Relief. Historian Claire Mouradian states that his activities over thirty years (from the Hamidian massacres to the creation of the Republic of Turkey) ""reveal a constant concern for raising awareness in favor of the Armenians, whose fate seemed to be a premonition of what might be awaiting Jews in Europe"".
Joining U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, and others, Wise laid the groundwork for a democratically elected, nationwide organization of 'ardently Zionist' Jews, 'to represent Jews as a group and not as individuals'. In 1917 he participated in the effort to convince President Woodrow Wilson to approve the Balfour declaration in support of Jewish settlement in Mandate Palestine. In 1918, following national elections, this Jewish community convened the first American Jewish Congress in Philadelphia's historic Independence Hall.
In December 1925, Wise delivered a sermon about Jesus the Jew, making the case that Jews should view Jesus ""as a great moral and ethical teacher, a Jew of whom they might be proud because of his teachings.""  This sermon caused an uproar among some Jewish institutions, culminating in an edict of condemnation against him by the Agudath Harabonim, the Union of Orthodox Rabbis.  Because of the outcry, Wise resigned from his position as Chairman of the United Palestine Appeal.  But he referred to the Orthodox condemnation as ""un-Jewish,"" and in a statement to the Jewish Telegraph Agency, he protested, ""What a mournful commentary upon the infinite hurt which the Jew has suffered at the hands of Christendom, that a Jewish teacher cannot even at this time speak of Jesus... without being hailed as a convert to Christianity or misunderstood by some of his fellow Jews....""
In 1938, as president of the American Jewish Congress, Wise said that adoption of the Alaska proposal in the Slattery Report would deliver ""a wrong and hurtful impression ... that Jews are taking over some part of the country for settlement.""


=== Friendship with Einstein ===
Albert Einstein found Wise's mixture of enlightened views and committed Zionism most agreeable, and they became friends when Einstein moved to the US. In a tribute to Wise on his 60th birthday, Einstein said, ""Above all, what I admire in him is his bold activity toward building the self-respect of the Jewish people, combined with profound tolerance and penetrating understanding of everything human.""


=== Views on Jerome Davis ===
During the trial of the sociologist Jerome Davis, Wise stated, based on more than 30 years of acquaintance, that Davis had ""never, never"" been sympathetic to communism.


=== Public and charitable offices ===
In 1902 Wise officiated as first vice-president of the Oregon State Conference of Charities and Correction.  In 1903 he was appointed Commissioner of Child Labor for the State of Oregon, and founded the Peoples' Forum of Oregon. These activities initiated a lifelong commitment to social justice, stemming from his embrace of a Jewish equivalent of the Social Gospel movement in Christianity.
In A History of Jews in America historian Howard Sachar wrote, ""In 1914, Professor Emeritus Joel Spingarn of Columbia University became chairman of the NAACP and recruited for its board such Jewish leaders as Jacob Schiff, Jacob Billikopf, and Rabbi Stephen Wise."" 

In 1922 Wise founded the Jewish Institute of Religion, an educational center in New York City to train rabbis in Reform Judaism. It was merged into the Hebrew Union College a year after his death. In 1922 Wise was one of the founding trustees of the Palestine Endowment Funds, Inc., along with Julian Mack.
When the Federation of American Zionists (FAZ) was originally established, Wise was appointed the position secretary. After the organization transformed into the Zionist Organization of America, Rabbi Wise fulfilled positions as both president and vice president during his lifetime.
Wise was a close friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who turned to Wise for advice on issues concerning the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, Wise had also acted a liaison to previous President Wilson.
At the 1924 Democratic National Convention, he was a delegate from New York; at the opening of the sixth session on June 28, 1924, he offered the invocation.  During the 1928 campaign, Wise was a prominent supporter of Democrat Al Smith.
In 1925 Wise became chairman of Keren Hayesod, while continuing efforts to bring the Reform movement around to a pro-Zionist stance. With the rise to power of Adolf Hitler's regime, Wise took the position that public opinion in the United States and elsewhere should be rallied against the Nazis. He used his influence with President Roosevelt both in this area as well as on the Zionist question.
In 1933 while acting as honorary president of the American Jewish Congress, Wise led efforts for a Jewish Boycott of Germany. He stated ""The time for prudence and caution is past. We must speak up like men. How can we ask our Christian friends to lift their voices in protest against the wrongs suffered by Jews if we keep silent? What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other land on earth unless it is challenged and rebuked. It is not the German Jews who are being attacked. It is the Jews"". Urged by Wise to protest to the German government, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull issued a mild statement to the American ambassador to Berlin complaining that ""unfortunate incidents have indeed occurred and the whole world joins in regretting them.""
Wise, along with Leo Motzkin and Nahum Goldmann, encouraged the creation in August 1936 of the World Jewish Congress in order to create a broader representative body to fight Nazism. Wise served as founding president of the World Jewish Congress president until his death in 1949. He was succeeded by his friend Nahum Goldmann.


=== Holocaust awareness ===
Given his position as an influential and highly visible leader of the American Jewish community, Wise was inevitably caught up in the dilemmas facing American policy-makers and Jewish activists when awareness began to grow of the systematic efforts by the Nazi regime to exterminate European Jewry.
Wise's steady nine-year campaign to publicly expose Nazi atrocities against Jews had borne little practical fruit.  Roosevelt was reluctant to spend political capital on behalf of foreign refugees, and access to visas and other paths of escape were effectively blocked by the assistant Secretary of State Breckenridge Long, an admirer of Hitler and Mussolini.
As early information of the full scale of the Nazi slaughter began to emerge from Europe, Jews in the U.S. and other countries were cast into an agonizing debate about how, and whether, to press governments to take steps to save them.
On August 8, 1942, Gerhart M Riegner, then representative of the World Jewish Congress in Geneva, sent a cable (now known as the Riegner Telegram) to British and American diplomatic contacts, informing the Allies for the first time about the full official Nazi plans.

Riegner asked that Stephen Wise be made aware of the cable's contents.  But U.S. State Department officials did not pass it along.  Wise was not informed about the telegram until Riegner sent him another cable directly, almost three weeks later, on August 29.  ""Received alarming report,"" the cable read, ""that in Fuhrers headquarters plan discussed and under consideration all Jews in countries occupied or controlled Germany number 3-1/2 to 4 million should after deportation and concentration in east should at one blow exterminated to resolve once for all Jewish question in Europe.""  This was precisely the plan that the Nazi regime was putting into motion.
Wise, innocent of the State Department's earlier receipt of the same news, passed this warning along to his government contacts.  And, as was his general policy, refrained from speaking out about the reports of mass slaughter until they had been fully vetted by the State Department.
It was almost four months before U.S. Under-secretary of State Sumner Welles confirmed to Wise that the Riegner Telegram's information was accurate.  Wise then held a press conference in Washington, D.C. On November 24, 1942, and announced that the Nazis had a plan for the extermination of all European Jews, and that the number of Jews murdered had already reached 2 million.
During the war years, Wise was elected co-chair of the American Zionist Emergency Council, a forerunner of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
Wise was an ardent opponent of the post-war efforts by Isaac Nachman Steinberg, co-founder of the Freeland League, to create a community for Jewish refugees in Suriname. In a letter to Keren Hayesod emissary Ida Silverman he wrote, ""I personally believe, that Steinberg needs to be lynched or hanged and quartered, if that would make his lamented demise more certain.""


== Works ==
Wise translated The Improvement of the Moral Qualities, an ethical treatise of the eleventh century by Solomon ibn Gabirol (New York, 1902) from the original Arabic, and wrote The Beth Israel Pulpit, among other works.  He was invited to deliver the annual Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Lecture at Union College in 1944.


== Criticism ==
Wise's liberal Judaism conflicted with the view of Orthodox and Conservative Jews of the time, a dispute that continues through the present. They felt he worked too closely with his government and was too cautious in accepting and publicizing the early reports of the Holocaust.
Holocaust scholar David Kranzler, author of ""Orthodoxy's Finest Hour,"" wrote in 2002 that Wise had a ""penchant for protecting his close friend and confidant US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) regardless of the cost to the Jews of Europe."" Kranzler accused Wise of failing to recognize the existential threat to European Jewry prior to American entry into World War II, dismissing early reports of the Final Solution as propaganda, and obstructing rescue efforts.
Kranzler also suggested that Wise did not voluntarily publicize the Holocaust after the Riegner cable, but rather that he was pressured into going public by the American Orthodox Jewish community, who confronted him after receiving what is known as the Sternbuch Report on September 2, 1942.  Kranzler wrote that Wise declined to publicize these reports until after the U.S. State Department had formally confirmed their accuracy, almost three months later.  Kranzler complained that ""Every time a unified committee for rescue was organized which was not entirely under Wise’s control, he would force the committee to dissolve.""
1940s screenwriter and Jewish activist Ben Hecht had been recruited to the inner circle of the Zionist movement known as the Bergson Group.  This was a committee led by Zionist Hillel Kook, who in his interactions with Americans favored the less alien-sounding alias Peter Bergson.  Bergson and his team were members of the Irgun, a radical faction of Zionists who favored direct action over slow diplomatic negotiation.  Bergson's original mission in the U.S. was to seek American help in creating an armed Jewish force to fight in the war.  In 1942, after Bergson read the news stories of Stephen Wise's November 24 press conference, he pivoted into a full-bore fight to combat the slaughter of European Jews.
The Bergson Group's stance on European Jewry was opposed to Wise's: they believed their actions would save more Jews from the Nazi Holocaust. Most American Jewish institutions sided with Wise; Bergson and Wise jockeyed for influence over U.S. policy.
As part of his collaboration with Bergson, Hecht created a giant pageant publicizing the Holocaust called We Will Never Die which debuted at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1943.  Hecht recruited show-business friends like Kurt Weill and Moss Hart to write and stage his pageant, and to raise public awareness of the Nazis' mass murder of Jews as stridently as possible.  As plans for the show accelerated, a disgruntled Hecht wrote that he was abruptly contacted by Wise:

Wise was successful in preventing some performances, but not the national broadcast, of We Will Never Die.
In the 2002 book A Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust, David Wyman and Rafael Medoff argued that Wise hindered the Holocaust rescue attempts of the Bergson Group and others.
Historian Saul Friedländer said that Wise prevented the shipment of food packages from American Jews to German-occupied Poland for fear that the Allies would interpret the aid as being sent to the enemy. Unlike Wise, Friedländer believed that the Nazis were distributing aid packages to the concentration camps and ghetto Jews.  In the spring of 1941, Rabbi Wise contacted the World Jewish Congress representatives in Europe to halt forthwith any shipment of packages to the ghettos. 'All these operations with and through Poland must cease at once,' Wise cabled to Congress delegates in London and Geneva, 'and at once in English means AT ONCE, not in the future.'"" 


== Personal life ==

Wise married Louise Waterman.  The couple had two children: writer James Wise (born 1901); and Judge Justine Wise Polier (1903–1987).
Wise died on April 19, 1949, in New York City, aged 75. He is interred in an unmarked mausoleum in Westchester Hills Cemetery located in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.
The Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, which he founded in 1907 and served as Rabbi until his death, is named after him, as is Stephen S. Wise Temple in Los Angeles, which was founded by Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin in 1964. A street is named after him in Jerusalem next to the Israel Museum, and others in Haifa, Rishon LeZion and Petah Tikvah.

52,"Zvi (Zwi) Hirsch Kalischer (24 March 1795 – 16 October 1874) was an Orthodox German rabbi who expressed views, from a religious perspective, in favour of the Jewish re-settlement of the Land of Israel, which predate Theodor Herzl and the Zionist movement. He was the grandfather of Salomon Kalischer.


== Life ==
Kalischer was born in Lissa in the Prussian Province of Posen (now Leszno in Poland). Destined for the rabbinate, he received his Talmudic education from Jacob of Lissa and Rabbi Akiva Eiger of Posen.
After his marriage he left Jacob of Lissa and settled in Thorn, a city on the Vistula River, then in Prussia and now Toruń, in northern Poland, where he spent the rest of his life.
In Toruń, he took an active interest in the affairs of the Jewish community, and for more than forty years held the office of Rabbinatsverweser (""acting rabbi""). Disinterestedness was a prominent feature of his character; he refused to accept any remuneration for his services. His wife, by means of a small business, provided their meager subsistence.

The name Zvi Hirsh is a bilingual tautological name in Yiddish.: 138  It means literally ""deer-deer"" and is traceable back to the Hebrew word צבי tsvi ""deer"" and the German word Hirsch ""deer"".: 138

In his youth he wrote Eben Bochan, a commentary on several juridical themes of the Shulkhan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat (Krotoschin, 1842), and Sefer Moznayim la-Mishpat, a commentary, in three parts on the whole Choshen Mishpat (parts i. and ii., Krotoschin and Königsberg, 1855; part iii. still in manuscript). He also wrote: Tzvi L'Tzadik (צבי לצדיק) glosses on the Shulkhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah, published in the new Vilna edition of that work; the Sefer ha-Berit commentary on the Pentateuch; the Sefer Yetzi'at Mitzrayim commentary on the Passover Pesach Haggadah; Chiddushim on several Talmudical treatises; etc. He also contributed largely to Hebrew magazines, as Ha-Maggid, Tziyyon, Ha-'Ibri, and Ha-Lebanon.


== Views on the re-settlement of the Land of Israel ==
Inclined to philosophical speculation, Kalischer studied the systems of medieval and modern Jewish and Christian philosophers, one result being his Sefer Emunah Yesharah, an inquiry into Jewish philosophy and theology (2 vols., Krotoschin, 1843, 1871); an appendix to volume 1 contains a commentary (incomplete) on Job and Ecclesiastes.
In the midst of his many activities, however, his thoughts centered on one idea: the settlement of the Land of Israel by Jews, in order to provide a home for the homeless Eastern European Jews and transform the many Jewish beggars in the Holy Land into a population which would be able to support itself by practicing agriculture.
He wrote in the Ha-Levanon, a Hebrew (at that period, a renovated language) monthly magazine. In 1862 he published his book Derishat Tzion (Lyck, 1862) on this subject, including many quotes from his commentaries in the Ha-Levanon magazine. He proposed:

To collect money for this purpose from Jews in all countries
To buy and cultivate land in Israel
To found an agricultural school, either in Israel itself or in France, and
To form a Jewish military guard for the security of the colonies.
He thought the time was especially favorable for the carrying out of this idea, as the sympathy of men like Isaac Moïse Crémieux, Moses Montefiore, Edmond James de Rothschild, and Albert Cohn rendered the Jews politically influential. To these and similar Zionist ideals he gave expression in his Derishat Zion, containing three theses:

The salvation of the Jews, which was promised by the Prophets, can only come about in a natural way — by self-help
Immigration to Israel
Admissibility of the observance of sacrifices in Jerusalem at the present day.
The appendix contains an invitation to the reader to become a member of the colonization societies of Israel.
The second part of the book is devoted to speaking to ""the nations"" which believe in the Bible and the prophets, and persuading them, that this new course in history is a logical one, and they too can hope for the salvation of the Jewish nation as part of the salvation of the entire world.
This book made a very great impression, especially in Eastern Europe. It was translated into German by Poper (Toruń, 1865), and a second Hebrew edition was issued by N. Friedland (Toruń, 1866). Kalischer himself traveled with indefatigable zeal to various German cities for the purpose of establishing colonization societies. It was his influence that caused Chayyim Lurie (Chaim Lorje 1821-1878) to form the first society of this kind (Association for the Colonisation of Palestine) in Frankfurt in 1860, and this was followed by the formation of other societies.
Owing to Kalischer's agitation, the Alliance Israélite Universelle founded the Mikveh Israel agricultural school in Palestine in 1870. He was offered the rabbinate, but he was too old to accept it. Although not all of these endeavors were attended with immediate success, Kalischer never lost hope. By exerting a strong influence upon his contemporaries, including such prominent men as Heinrich Grätz, Moses Hess (see Rome and Jerusalem, pp. 117 et seq.), and others, he is considered to have been one of the most important of those who prepared the way for the foundation of modern Zionism.


== Notable Opposition ==
Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch was vocally opposed to Kalischer's proto-zionistic views, writing “We are obligated to follow the ‘well-trodden paths of our ancestors and early leaders,’ who never mentioned any obligation for us to encourage the geulah (redemption) by developing Eretz Yisroel. They mention as the path toward the Redemption only that we become better Jews, repent, and look forward to the geulah.”

54,"Joseph David Wijnkoop (14 August 1842 in Amsterdam – 1 October 1910 in Amsterdam) was a Dutch rabbi and scholar in Jewish studies. He was a pupil of Rabbi Jacob Moses Content (1818–1898). Among the Jews of Amsterdam, he was known and respected for his liberal and practical ideas.


== Life ==
Wijnkoop was born in a family of small retailers. He studied at the Dutch Israelite Seminary, a religious school related to the Ashkenazi Jews. He also studied Classical language at the University of Amsterdam. Wijnkoop was the first trainee rabbi who did both academical courses, before it became mandatory. In 1870, he finished his studies at the Jewish Seminary and was rewarded the ""Moré-diploma"", the highest degree available.
Later in 1870 he was appointed rabbi at the Nederlands-Israëlietische Hoofdsynagoge, the Ashkenazi-Jewish community of Amsterdam. He was the successor of rabbi Joseph Tsewie Hirsch. From 1901, he was also lecturer in the New-Hebrew at the University of Amsterdam.
In 1902, Wijnkoop was also appointed as Chief Rabbi of Amersfoort. He resigned this post in 1904, because it was incompatible with his work as rabbi in Amsterdam. Due to his very bad relationship with the chief rabbi of Amsterdam Joseph Hirsch Dünner, it is likely that he forced Wijnkoop out of this post.
Another position he held was that of board member of the Etz Chaim of Beth Hamidrasch.
In 1902, Wijnkoop was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau.
Joseph Wijnkoop died in 1910, aged 68.


== Books ==
Wijnkoop has written several books, including commentaries on Bible books:

Handleiding tot de kennis der Hebreeuwsche taal ; 1888-1901, two volumes First volume also translated in English: Manual of Hebrew Syntax by Rev. J. D. Wijnkoop, Translated from the Dutsoh by Rev. Dr. C. van den Biesen, prof. of Theology at St. Joseph's Foreign Missionary College, Mill-Hill.

55,"Heinemann Vogelstein (February 13, 1841 - August 4, 1911) was a German rabbi and leader of Reform Judaism in Germany.


== Biography ==
Heinemann Vogelstein was born in Lippe on February 13, 1841, the son of Julie (née Adler) and Israel Vogelstein.

In 1861, he became a member of the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums.
He was rabbi in Pilsen (1868-1880) and Stettin (from 1880 until his death), founder and chairman (until his death) of the Vereinigung der liberalen Rabbiner (Union of Liberal Rabbis) and Deputy Chairman of the Vereinigung für das Liberale Judentum in Deutschland (Union for Liberal Judaism in Germany). From 1894 to 1896 he published a book of prayers in two volumes in which all references to Jewish nationalism had been eliminated.
As an opponent of Zionism he joined the protest movement in 1897 and published a pamphlet in 1906 entitled Der Zionismus, eine Gefahr für die gedeihliche Entwickelung des Judentums (Zionism, a Danger to the Prosperous Development of Judaism). In 1889, he wrote Kampf zwischen Priestern und Leviten seit den Tagen Ezechiels (Struggle between priests and the Levites since the days of Ezekiel).
In 1928, a street was named after him in Szczecin.

58,"Aaron Tänzer (German: Aron Tänzer, Hungarian: Tänzer Áron; also German: Arnold Tänzer; January 30, 1871 – February 26, 1937, Göppingen) was a rabbi in Austria and Germany, chaplain and author.


== Biography ==
He was born in Pressburg, Austria-Hungary (present day Bratislava, Slovakia).
He studied at the Pressburg Yeshiva, and studied Oriental philology and history at the University of Berlin (PhD 1895). In 1896, he was called to Hohenems, Austria as chief rabbi of Tyrol and Vorarlberg; and from 1904 to 1907 he was rabbi of Meran (Tyrol). From 1907 until his death, he served as rabbi of the Jewish community of Göppingen in Württemberg, Germany. His history of the Jews of Göppingen and nearby Jebenhausen is notable as a thorough documentation of a Jewish community from its beginnings.
In World War I, he served as a Feldrabbiner (Jewish chaplain) in the German army, primarily on the Eastern front. He looked after German and Austrian Jewish soldiers and took care of Jewish prisoners of war in POW camps like Doeberitz and Sedan.
Aron Tänzer's father was a rabbi and his mother worked as a seamstress for the Pressburg Jewish community. At the age of 21, Aron Tänzer enrolled at the University of Berlin. He studied philosophy, German and Semitic philology. Aron Tänzer received his doctorate in 1895 and in October 1896 he successfully applied for the vacant rabbinical position in Hohenems, Austria.
The Hohenems rabbinate also supervised nearby Jewish communities in Vorarlberg and, from 1878 to 1914, also formally the Jews living in Tyrol. Tänzer applied his extensive training in history to numerous scientific publications as well as the field of adult education. For example, he often gave lectures on literature and history for the Hohenems Education Club. In 1905 he published the history of the Jews in Hohenems, which is still considered the standard work today. His mindset and religious beliefs were shaped by liberal ideas and cultural openness.
From 1905 to 1907 Tänzer was a rabbi of the Jewish community of Meran [1] and from September 1, 1907, became a rabbi at the Göppingen synagogue. He held this position, in which he was responsible for the Jebenhausen district rabbinate, until his death in 1937. Right at the beginning of the First World War, Tänzer volunteered to work as a field rabbi. He served on the Eastern Front for three years. Tänzer looked after the soldiers, helped in the hospital and set up people's kitchens for the needy population. Tänzer was awarded several medals for his work in the field.
Tänzer laid the foundation for a public library, later the city library in Göppingen, since 1909. Since 1921 he was an honorary member of the Göppingen veterans and military association ""Kampfgemeinschaft"". The Rabbiner-Tänzer-Haus (Freihofstrasse 46), the former rabbinate building, in Göppingen was dedicated to the Taenzer family.

59,"Abraham Cohen (Abraham ben Shabbetai ha-Kohen) (1670 – 1729) was a Jewish physician, rabbi, religious philosopher and poet on Zante (Zakynthos), an Ionian Island, and an overseas colony of the Venetian Republic.
Cohen's family was moderately wealthy and lived on Crete where he was born, although he lived most of his adult life in the town of Zante where he practiced medicine. He was a scholar and graduated as a physician from the University of Padua.


== Work ==
In 1700 Cohen published in Venice his Derashot 'al ha-Torah, a common title for homilies (sermons) and commentary on the Pentateuch (Torah). His Derashot 'al ha-Torah is also known as Kebod Chacamim or Kevod Ḥakhamim (The Glory of Wise Men).  In 1719 he published in Venice his Kehunnat Abraham (כהנת אברהם), a book of religious poems in Hebrew written in the manner of and inspired by the Psalms (Tehillim). Cohen used a number of different meters in his poetry. His Kehunnat Abraham created a stir within the Jewish community of the Venetian Republic and other parts of Italy, full of compliments. Joseph Fiametta published a poem in praise of it, as did Issac Vita Cantarini and Shabbethai Marini, both in the mode of the times, sonnet form. Cohen's engraved self-portrait appears on the fly-leaf of his Kehunnat Abraham complete with wig.
In 1879 M. Ventura of Corfu found a Hebrew poem by Cohen inscribed on the wall of the synagogue in Candia, Crete, and later published his discovery.

60,"Abraham Cronbach (February 15, 1882 – April 2, 1965) was an American rabbi and teacher, known as a pacifist.  He served as a rabbi for congregations in Indiana and Ohio.  Cronbach was one of the founders of the Peace Heroes Memorial Society.


== Early life and education ==
Abraham Cronbach was born to German immigrants Marcus and Hannah (Itzig) Cronbach.  Marcus was a notions store retailer in Indianapolis, Indiana, where Abraham grew up.  ""Abraham was an introspective boy, with a precocious and mystic conception of both God and the devil (he thought the devil was responsible for the smoke from the manhole in the street).""  He grew up in a Christian neighborhood where anti-Semitism and extreme poverty were common.  He played violin as a boy as well as read a lot on religion and science.  In high school Cronbach decided he would become a rabbi despite his parents' opposition.
Cronbach entered the Hebrew Union College (HUC) in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1898 where, in conjunction with the University of Cincinnati he studied for his bachelor's degree and trained for the rabbinate.  He graduated in 1902 from the University of Cincinnati and, in 1906 was valedictorian of his HUC class and was ordained as a rabbi.
On October 7, 1917 Cronbach married Rose Hentel, a teacher at the Free Synagogue in New York City whom he met during his time there.  In 1923 the Cronbachs adopted a daughter, Marion.  Later Cronbach would become the teacher of rabbinic student, Maurice Davis who would become a leader in the anti-cult movement and Cronbach's son-in-law.


== Early career ==

Cronbach first served as rabbi at the reform congregation of Temple Beth El in South Bend, Indiana.  In 1911 he spent a year studying at the University of Cambridge in England and the Hochschule fur die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin.  In 1915 he received the Doctor of Divinity degree from Hebrew Union College.
After resigning his pulpit in South Bend in 1915 Cronbach spent three years devoting himself to the chaplaincy in prison and hospital installations.  He developed strong convictions about the futility of the prison system.  He eventually befriended Nathan Leopold.  His interest in prisoners never faded and only increased his detestation of revenge and retribution and made Cronbach a strong opponent of capital punishment and the entire prison system.

If Cronbach had the power, he would destroy all jails and prisons, which he regards as instruments of societal vengeance which corrupt both the prisoners and society itself, and he would confine law-breakers to new institutions for psychological treatment and social retraining.
Cronbach spent the next seven years serving in three different rabbinical capacities: from 1915 and 1917 he worked with the Free Synagogue in New York City; from 1917 through 1919 he served as Rabbi at Temple Israel in Akron, Ohio; and from 1919 through 1922 he served as the institutional chaplain for the Chicago Federation of Synagogues.


== Lecturer and educator ==
In December 1920, Cronbach delivered a series of lectures on chaplaincy procedures at Hebrew Union College (""The Ministry of the Jewish By-Ways.""  Hebrew Union College Monthly, January - April, 1921).  In 1922, Cronbach was appointed a professor of social studies at Hebrew Union College, where he remained for the rest of his life.
While teaching at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cronbach participated in Cincinnati's Jewish Fellowship House and the Cincinnati Big Brother's Association.  He was also an active member of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now known as the Union for Reform Judaism).
In 1939 Cronbach became secretary to the Board of Editors of the Hebrew Union College Annual.

Among the striking aspects of Judaism…is that of extolling certain texts as sacred and then using those texts to convey meanings far different from anything their authors had in mind. The most prevalent example of this is the…d’rash [sermon]. The propounding of such unmeant meanings however has not been limited to sermons. The Bible has undergone manipulation not only in the act of preaching…. Some of the weightiest thoughts emerging from the Bible have been thoughts that never existed in the minds of those who wrote the Bible.


== Pacifism and life during the World Wars ==
[War] entails a problem from which no one's attention can long be averted and an issue none dares evade.  War is not a horror.  It is a combination of horrors.


=== Early pacifist actions ===
As a result of World War I, Cronbach became an ardent pacifist.  He helped found the Peace Heroes Memorial Society in 1923.  The Society's national headquarters were located in Cincinnati.  Cronbach served as national secretary and was instrumental in establishing Memorial Day services around the country in honor of the heroes of industry, maternity, pacifism, etc.  These services were an annual event in Cincinnati from 1923 through 1941.
Cronbach attempted to establish a specifically Jewish pacifist organization in 1924.  A ""Pledge for Jewish Pacifists"" was sent out.  Fifteen signed pledges were returned including ones from Maximilian Heller and Jacob Weinstein however a formal organization never developed.  Cronbach desisted from the project at the request of the College Board of Hebrew Union College who saw Cronbach as a public relations problem that was ""too serious to be overlooked in the name of academic freedom.""


=== Controversy during World War II ===
With the threat and advent of World War II Cronbach's pacifist activities increased.  Cronbach was familiar with controversy due to his pacifist beliefs.  In 1935 he called for a conference between Nazis and Jews in Philadelphia for the purpose of reconciliation. During that same year he worked with the American Friends Service Committee to raise $5000 for an Austrian Relief Fund to aid persecuted Austrians, and German Jews and Nazis who had fled to Austria to escape Hitler's Germany.


=== Jewish Peace Fellowship ===
In 1942 along with Rabbi Isidor Hoffman and Jane Evans, Cronbach established the Jewish Peace Fellowship, which caused a brief collision between Cronbach and the College Board of Hebrew Union College.  The Jewish Peace Fellowship has had many prominent Jews as associates including Rabbi Leo Baeck, Albert Einstein, and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel.  For more than 50 years, Jewish Peace Fellowship has helped young Jewish conscientious objectors and is still active today.  Cronbach has been quoted describing the fellowship as a

religious organization of Jewish persons who believe war to be as futile as it is fiendish.


=== The impact of the Holocaust ===
Throughout the Holocaust Cronbach felt the weight of the suffering of the German Jews; he wore a ""yellow badge"", the yellow Star of David, sewn by his wife.  At the end of the war when Cronbach's friend Rabbi Leo Baeck returned after being imprisoned in a concentration camp he and Cronbach exchanged their yellow stars; the one Baeck had been forced to wear as a sign of oppression and the one Cronbach willingly wore in support of his suffering brethren.  Baeck's yellow star now resides with Cronbach's two grandsons.
After the Allied victory of World War II Cronbach addressed letters to such Jewish organizations as the American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Conference, and the American Jewish Congress asking that they not seek punishment of Nazi war criminals.


=== Views on Zionism ===
Cronbach was not dogmatic on the issue of Zionism but generally hewed to the views instilled by his Classical Reform training, and remained consistent in opposing Israeli militarism.  He became active with the American Council for Judaism and was a revered member of its leadership until his death.


== Rosenbergs ==
In 1952 Cronbach became a sponsor of the Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case and worked for the committee for the next two years.  Cronbach carried on an active letter writing campaign that urged others to help secure clemency for the Rosenbergs.  ""In May 1953, a Conference of Inquiry was held, sponsored by such people as Rabbi Abraham Cronbach and Mary Church Terrell on the national level.""
On June 16, 1953 Cronbach met with President Eisenhower to urge him to pardon the Rosenbergs.  Cronbach compiled a book about his experience with the Rosenberg case.
Cronbach appeared with Julius Rosenberg's mother and the Rosenbergs two small sons at a protest meeting in front of the White House after the Rosenbergs had been found guilty.  Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed at Sing Sing prison in New York on June 19, 1953, more than two years after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage.  Cronbach gave a eulogy at the Rosenberg's funeral on June 21, 1953.  ""Rabbi Cronbach's impassioned eulogy [...] is an eloquent statement against excessive punishment and in favor of the positive synergy existing between American patriotism and Judaism.""
Cronbach's eulogy for the Rosenbergs can be found in the Abraham Cronbach collection at the Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives.


== Later life ==

In 1950 Cronbach retired from active teaching and became Emeritus Professor of Social Studies at Hebrew Union College.  From then on he devoted most of his time to writing and published numerous articles and several books including ""The Realities of Religion: A New Approach"", ""Stories Made of Bible Stories"", ""The Quest for Peace"", and ""The Bible and Our Social Outlook"".
Ohel Avraham Synagogue (formerly Cronbach Chapel) at The Leo Baeck Education Center in Haifa, Israel was named in honor of Cronbach by the National Federation of Temple Youth (now known as the North American Federation of Temple Youth or NFTY).
Cronbach died in Cincinnati, Ohio. He is interred near his home in the Clifton neighborhood of Cincinnati.  His wife was interred with him in 1982.

61,"Rabbi Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz (11 July 1937 – 7 August 2020) (Hebrew: עדין אבן-ישראל שטיינזלץ) was an Israeli Chabad Chasidic rabbi, teacher, philosopher, social critic, author, translator and publisher.
His Steinsaltz edition of the Talmud was originally published in modern Hebrew, with a running commentary to facilitate learning, and has also been translated into English, French, Russian, and Spanish. Beginning in 1989, Steinsaltz published several tractates in Hebrew and English of the Babylonian (Bavli) Talmud in an English-Hebrew edition. The first volume of a new English-Hebrew edition, the Koren Talmud Bavli, was released in May 2012, and has since been brought to completion.
Steinsaltz was a recipient of the Israel Prize for Jewish Studies (1988), the President's Medal (2012), and the Yakir Yerushalayim prize (2017).
Steinsaltz died in Jerusalem on 7 August 2020 from acute pneumonia.


== Biography ==

Adin Steinsaltz was born in Jerusalem on 11 July 1937 to Avraham Steinsaltz and Leah (née Krokovitz). His father was a great-grandson of the first Slonimer Rebbe, Avrohom Weinberg, and was a student of Hillel Zeitlin. Avraham and Leah Steinsaltz met through Zeitlin. They immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1924. Avraham Steinsaltz, a devoted communist and member of Lehi, went to Spain in 1936 to fight with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. Adin was born the following year.
Steinsaltz became a baal teshuva during his teenage years and learned from Rabbi Shmuel Elazar Heilprin (Rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Toras Emes Chabad). He studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the Hebrew University, in addition to rabbinical studies at Yeshivas Tomchei Temimim in Lod and with Rabbis Dov Ber Eliezrov and Shmaryahu Noach Sasonkin. Following graduation, he established several experimental schools after an unsuccessful attempt to start a neo-Hassidic community in the Negev desert, and, at the age of 24, became Israel's youngest school principal.
In 1965, he founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications and began his monumental work on the Talmud, including translation into Hebrew, English, Russian, and various other languages. The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud include translation from the original Aramaic and a comprehensive commentary. Steinsaltz completed his Hebrew edition of the entire Babylonian Talmud in November 2010, at which time Koren Publishers Jerusalem became the publisher of all of his works, including the Talmud. While not without criticism (such as by Jacob Neusner, 1998), the Steinsaltz edition is widely used throughout Israel, the United States, and the world.
Steinsaltz's classic work on Kabbalah, The Thirteen Petalled Rose, was first published in 1980, and now appears in eight languages. In all, Steinsaltz authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects including Talmud, Jewish mysticism, Jewish philosophy, sociology, historical biography, and philosophy. Many of these works have been translated into English by his close personal friend, now deceased, Yehuda Hanegbi. His memoir-biography on the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, was published by Maggid Books (2014).
Continuing his work as a teacher and spiritual mentor, Steinsaltz joined the original faculty of the nondenominational Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem in 1972, along with David Hartman, Eliezer Schweid, Menachem Froman, Dov Berkovits, and others. He established Yeshivat Mekor Chaim alongside Rabbis Menachem Froman and Shagar in 1984 and Yeshivat Tekoa in 1999. He also served as president of the Shefa Middle and High Schools. He has served as scholar in residence at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His honorary degrees include doctorates from Yeshiva University, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Bar Ilan University, Brandeis University, and Florida International University. Steinsaltz was also Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Hesder Tekoa.
Being a follower of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of Chabad-Lubavitch, he went to help Jews in the Soviet Union assisting Chabad's shluchim (propagators) network. In 1995, the chief Rabbi of Russia, Adolph Shayevich gave Steinzaltz the title of Duchovny Ravin (Spiritual Rabbi), a historic Russian title which indicated that he was the spiritual mentor of Russian Jewry. In this capacity, Steinsaltz travelled to Russia and the Republics once each month from his home in Jerusalem. During his time in the former Soviet Union, he founded the Jewish University, both in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The Jewish University is the first degree-granting institution of Jewish studies in the former Soviet Union. In 1991, on Schneersohn's advice, he changed his family name from Steinsaltz to Even-Israel. Besides Chabad, Steinsaltz was also inspired by the teachings of the Kotzker Rebbe. He was in close contact with the fifth Gerrer Rebbe, Yisroel Alter, and his brother and successor, Simcha Bunim Alter.
Steinsaltz took a cautious approach to interfaith dialogues. During a visit of a delegation of Roman Catholic cardinals in Manhattan in January 2004, he said that, ""You do not have to raise over-expectations of a meeting, as it doesn't signify in itself a breakthrough; however, the opportunity for cardinals and rabbis to speak face to face is valuable. It's part of a process in which we can talk to each other in a friendly way"", and called for ""a theological dialogue that asks the tough questions, such as whether Catholicism allows for Jews to enter eternal paradise"".
Steinsaltz and his wife lived in Jerusalem until his death and had three children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In 2016, Steinsaltz suffered a stroke, leaving him unable to speak. His son, Rabbi Menachem (""Meni"") Even-Israel, is the executive director of the Steinsaltz Center, Rabbi Steinsaltz's umbrella organization, located in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem.
Steinsaltz died in Jerusalem on 7 August 2020, from acute pneumonia, at the Shaare Tzedek Medical Center. He was hospitalized earlier in the week with a severe lung infection. His wife Sarah survived him, together with three children and eighteen grandchildren.


== Head of the new Sanhedrin ==

Steinsaltz accepted the position as Nasi (President) of the 2004 attempt to revive the Sanhedrin. In 2008, he resigned from this position due to differences of opinion.


== As an author ==

Steinsaltz was a prolific author and commentator who wrote numerous books on Jewish knowledge, tradition and culture, and produced original commentaries on the entirety of the Jewish canon: Tanakh (the Jewish bible), the Babylonian Talmud, the Mishna, the Mishneh Torah, and Tanya.

Prior to his stroke, he gave evening seminars in Jerusalem, which, according to Newsweek, usually lasted until 2:00 in the morning and attracted prominent politicians, such as the former Prime Minister Levi Eshkol and former Finance Minister Pinchas Sapir.


== Awards and critical reception ==
On 21 April 1988, Steinsaltz received the Israel Prize for Jewish Studies.
On 9 February 2012, Steinsaltz was honored by Israeli President Shimon Peres with Israel's first President's Prize alongside Zubin Mehta, Uri Slonim, Henry Kissinger, Judy Feld Carr, and the Rashi Foundation.[15] Steinsaltz was presented with this award for his contribution to the study of Talmud, making it more accessible to Jews worldwide.
Steinsaltz was also presented with the 2012 National Jewish Book Award in the category of Modern Jewish Thought & Experience by the Jewish Book Council for his commentary, translation, and notes in the Koren Babylonian Talmud. The Modern Jewish Thought & Experience award was awarded on 15 January 2013 in memory of Joy Ungerleider Mayerson by the Dorot Foundation.
On 22 May 2017, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat visited Steinsaltz at his home to present him with the Yakir Yerushalayim (""Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem"") medal. This medal of achievement was awarded to Steinsaltz for his writing and translating work.
On 10 June 2018, Steinsaltz was honored at a Gala Dinner at the Orient Hotel in Jerusalem for his pedagogical achievements throughout a lifetime dedicated to Jewish education. A limited-edition version of ""The Steinsaltz Humash"" was presented to the attendees of this event.


== Public reception ==


=== Academic criticism ===
Jacob Neusner's How Adin Steinsaltz Misrepresents the Talmud. Four False Propositions from his ""Reference Guide"" (1998) displays strong disagreement. In what was an overall favorable review, Dr. Jeremy Brown notes that the Koren Talmud Bavli contains some inaccurate scientific information, such as identifying Ursa Major as a star and describing polycythemia vera as a disease causing excessive bleeding from the gums and from ordinary cuts. Aharon Feldman penned a lengthy critical review of the Steinsaltz Talmud contending that the work ""is marred by an extraordinary number of inaccuracies stemming primarily from misreadings of the sources; it fails to explain those difficult passages which the reader would expect it to explain; and it confuses him with notes which are often irrelevant, incomprehensible, and contradictory."" Feldman says he fears that, ""An intelligent student utilizing the Steinsaltz Talmud as his personal instructor might in fact conclude that Talmud in general is not supposed to make sense."" Furthermore, writes Feldman, the Steinsaltz Talmud gives off the impression that the Talmud is ""intellectually flabby, inconsistent, and often trivial.""


=== Haredi reaction and ban ===
Publication of the Steinsaltz Hebrew translation of the Talmud in the 1960s received endorsements from prominent rabbis including Moshe Feinstein and Ovadia Yosef. However, in 1989, when the English version appeared, Steinsaltz faced a fierce backlash from many leading rabbis in Israel such as Elazar Shach, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Eliezer Waldenberg, Nissim Karelitz, Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg, and Shmuel Wosner, who harshly condemned his work and other publications. Branding him a heretic, Shach was at the forefront of a campaign which banned all his works, believing that his literary and psychological explanations of biblical characters and events rendered them heretical. He also slated his translation of the Talmud, describing it as being written in the style of a secular book causing ""any trace of holiness and faith to vanish."" Waldenberg wrote that he was shocked to see the way in which Steinsaltz described the Patriarchs and Talmudic sages, writing that the works had the power to ""poison the souls"" of those who read them. Striking a more conciliatory tone in the controversy, however, were the Gerer Hasidim who praised his works and commended him on his willingness to amend various passages ""which could have been misconstrued."" After the Jerusalem-based Edah Charedis limited the ban to three books, Steinsaltz publicly apologised for his error and offered to refund anyone who had bought the books. The ban nevertheless caused thousands of schools and individuals to discard the Steinsaltz Talmud, with Rabbi Avigdor Nebenzahl ordering all copies to be placed in genizah. This led to more liberal Jewish movements placing adverts in the press asking for the edition to be donated to their institutions instead. For his part, Steinsaltz countered that much of the criticism he faced was rooted in opposition to the Chabad-Lubavitch community with which he was affiliated.


=== Praise ===
While certain members of the Haredi community may have opposition to Steinsaltz's works, other Jewish leaders, rabbis, and authors have spoken or written about their appreciation for Steinsaltz's unique educational approach. Rabbi John Rosove of Temple Israel of Hollywood featured ""Opening The Tanya"", ""Learning the Tanya"", and ""Understanding the Tanya"" on his list of the top ten recommended Jewish books. These volumes are written by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the founder of the Chabad Lubavitch movement, and include commentary by Steinsaltz. Through reading the Tanya, readers can explore all aspects of the central text of Chabad movement. Rabbi Elie Kaunfer, a rosh yeshiva and the CEO of Mechon Hadar Yeshiva, discussed his gratitude for Steinsaltz's Global Day of Jewish Learning and the opportunity created by this online platform for learning and creating a deeper connection to Torah, other Jewish text, and Jews worldwide. Rabbi Pinchas Allouche, who studied under Steinsaltz, notes that Steinsaltz ""is a world scholar"" who ""revolutionized the Jewish landscape"" through his commentary, other writings, and educational organizations. In 1988, secular Israeli historian Zeev Katz compared Steinsaltz's importance to that of Rashi and Maimonides, two Jewish scholars of medieval times. In addition, Ilana Kurshan, an American-Israeli author, wrote that Steinsaltz's ability to bring ""the historical world of the Talmudic stages to life"" created an enjoyable Jewish learning experience for her when she was intensely studying Talmud.

62,"Ahron Daum (Hebrew: אהרן דאום; January 6, 1951 – June 27, 2018) was an Israeli-born Modern-Orthodox rabbi, educator, author, and former chief rabbi of Frankfurt am Main from 1987 to 1993. From 1995 until his death in 2018, he was a lecturer at the Faculty for Comparative Religion in Antwerp, Belgium.


== Personal life and education ==
Ahron Daum was born on January 6, 1951, in Bnei Brak, Israel. He was born into a religious Ashkenazi family. His father Schmuel Daum was an important educator, writer, and communal figure, hailing from a prominent rabbinic family from Poland and Bohemia. His mother Rivka Gina Daum hailed from a prosperous trader family in Sopron, Hungary. He has three younger brothers.
His intensive religious training began at age 13 in the famous Lithuanian-Chassidic “Ruzhin” Yeshiva in Bnei Brak. At age 14, he left for the UK where he continued his studies at the Yeshiva Ha-Rama and later on moved to the well-known Zionistic Yeshiva Etz Chaim in Montreux, Switzerland.
In 1975, after obtaining his Baccalaureate Degree in Switzerland, he went to Jews’ College, University of London, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Jewish Studies (with Honours). From 1978 he attended the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS '82) of Yeshiva University, New York City where he obtained a master's degree in Biblical Studies (with Honours) and his rabbinical ordination personally signed and handed by Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik. Declining the offer to continue his studies in order to obtain the title of Dayan, he returned to Europe where he married Francine Frenkel with whom he has three daughters. He speaks Hebrew, English, German, French, Dutch and Yiddish and has a passive knowledge of Aramaic and Latin.


== Rabbinical career ==

In 1982 he started his rabbinical career in Switzerland as a community Rabbi in the town of Biel, a bilingual French/German town. He left this post in 1986 to become a doctoral fellow at the Christlich-Jüdische Institut in Lucerne, affiliated with the Theological Faculty of the University of Lucerne, Switzerland.
In 1987 he accepted the post of Chief Rabbi of the Jewish Community of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, which at the time was home to the largest Jewish Community of West Germany.
During his tenure Germany received a great wave of Russian-Jewish immigrants from streaming from the former Soviet Union. Daum's task was to aid these new arrivals – who had often been detached from their Jewish roots for over 90 years – to integrate them into the Jewish Community. This often proved to be very complex, as in the Soviet Union little to no effort had been done to strengthen their Jewish identity. One of Daum's first tasks as community Rabbi in Frankfurt am Main was to resolve the challenging problem of clarifying the Jewish status of the newcomers.
Daum was the driving force in the community regarding religious and cultural activities, not only but especially for the new members of the Jewish Community hailing from the Former Soviet Union. He organized Jewish culture days featuring e.g. Jewish Klezmer music and speakers specializing in the field of religious outreach, adapted to the needs of the new community members from the Former Soviet Union, and heritage tours to places of immense Jewish historical value, cities such as Worms, Mainz, and Michelstadt.
During his 5 years time in office as Rabbi of the community in Frankfurt, Rabbi Ahron Daum was the sole acting Rabbi. He fulfilled the full scope of tasks for the community in Frankfurt, which at that time counted approximately 6000-7000 people. He pulled the strings for all services on Shabbat and festivals, including sermons dealing with contemporary issues. Besides giving regular Torah lessons on Shabbat and weekdays to the members of the community, he regularly visited the four existing synagogues and additionally paid regular visits to the two existing Jewish old-age homes on the occasion of the High Holidays, Chanukkah and Pesach. He regularly took part in funerals and made Shive visits, regardless of the status of the deceased member; known or unknown, rich or poor. He had been supervising the Kashrut of the community institutions, such as the restaurants, the butcher shops, kosher meals for Lufthansa and occasional celebrations, like Bar-/Bat Mitzvahs and marriages in big hotels. Additionally it had been very important for Rabbi Daum to instigate the renovation of the Mikvah according to the high standards of the Halacha. With the support of Rabbi Meir Posen, at that time the greatest Halachical authority on the construction of Mikvahs in Europe, he ensured that the high Halachical standards and the Kashrut of the Mikvah in Frankfurt would be met. Leading not only the yearly communal Passover Seders with several hundred participants, he also organized a community Sukkah for the community members and frequently invited community members to his Shabbat table, not distinguishing between members from the center or the periphery of the community. Together with this father, Shmuel Daum, he regularly organized Kabbalat Shabbat youth-Minyanim in the Baumweg Synagogue and during his time in office he had also been the Av Beth Din of Frankfurt. As such he actively dealt with Giyurim, questions concerning Kashrut, Dinei Torah and religious divorces (Gittin). Regarding Giyurim Rabbi Daum has the experience from both the perspective of a religious Rabbinical judge (Beth Din), as well as a teacher and mentor. He embodies over 15 years of experience preparing non-Jews who wish to become Jewish for their Halachic recognized Giyur.
In 1993, for family reasons, he resigned from his post as Chief Rabbi and moved to Antwerp, Belgium, where the largest part of his family already lived. There he started to teach Judaism within the state school system and in Jewish day schools. In 1995 he accepted a position as lecturer in Jewish Law at the Faculty for Comparative Religion in Wilrijk (Antwerp), Belgium. In recognition of his teaching there and his works on Halacha the Faculty awarded him a Professorship Honoris Causa in Jewish Law. Since 2001 he also started, along with his wife, a series of outreach projects for Baalei Tshuva, non-Jews interested in Jewish studies and prospective converts to Judaism. Today this takes up most of his time and efforts and as part of these outreach activities he regularly organizes, in cooperation with the Netherlands-based Shalom Centre, study days on various topics within the field of Jewish studies.


== Work and publications ==
Rabbi Ahron Daum was a prolific author who has written on a diverse scope of topics within the field of Jewish studies.
Whilst living in Switzerland he was a regular contributor of Halachic articles to the Jewish Swiss-German weekly ""Jüdische Rundschau"". During his tenure as Chief Rabbi of Frankfurt am Main, he regularly wrote articles for ""Die Jüdische Allgemeine"" and the bi-monthly magazine ""Die Gemeinde"". Since 2010 he wrote a monthly column for the magazine Joods Actueel, the most widely circulated Jewish publication in Belgium. In those columns he coverEd the whole spectrum of Jewish Studies, for example his well-liked series on the history of Judaism since the Enlightenment.
He was the author of two books. His first book ""Halacha aktuell"" is a two-volume work, written in German, which treats Halachic problems and issues of current interest as they appear in the Halachic literature and more specifically the Responsa. This work is unique in that it was the first book written in German during the post-war period that comprehensively deals with Halachic issues in the Responsa literature. It was therefore welcomed with great enthusiasm in the Halachic world and received approbations from many distinguished Halachic authorities. Certain articles from this book were written in Rabbinic Hebrew and were later separately published under the title ""Iyunim b’Halacha"".
His second book was ""Die Jüdische Feiertage in Sicht der Tradition"" (The Jewish Festivals in View of the Tradition). It is a two-volume anthology combining Halachic articles, sermons, liturgical remarks, homiletic thoughts and folkloric and humorous tales connected to the Jewish holidays and Shabbat.
He is presently working on a number of books in Dutch covering such diverse topics as Kabbalah, Jewish History, the contemporary Jewish World and its different affiliations and other issues.

63,"Albert Jean Amateau (April 20, 1889 – February 9, 1996) was a Turkish rabbi, businessman, lawyer, social activist, and denier of the Armenian genocide.


== Early years ==
Born a Sephardic Jew in Milas, Ottoman Empire (now Turkey), Amateau attended the American International College in İzmir (Smyrna), Turkey. He emigrated to the United States in 1910 to escape conscription after the ""Young Turks"" revolution of 1908.


== Activism ==
In the early 1920s, Amateau began a movement to bring more Jews into the workplace and government. He was also involved largely in the affairs of deaf people. After he returned from serving in the army in World War I, Amateau was ordained in 1920 at the Jewish Theological Seminary, and he became the first rabbi of a congregation of the deaf. In 1941, Amateau developed the Albert J. Amateau Foreign Language Service, a business providing translators for lipsync dubbing for motion pictures which continued in operation until 1989.
An ardent supporter of his homeland of Turkey, Amateau began various Turkish-oriented organizations while residing in the United States. In 1992, at the age of 103, he helped found the American Society of Jewish Friends of Turkey and was named as its president.

Amateau was also an ""advocate of peace"", and in 1937, he assisted with negotiations between Jews and Arabs of Palestine.
He made a Sworn Statement denying the Armenian genocide in Turkey (1915–1923) to oppose approval of a resolution to recognize the said genocide, introduced by Senator Robert Dole in the United States Senate.
Amateau died in 1996 at the age of 106 years, 9 months, 20 days.

64,"Rabbi Allen Secher (born February 14, 1935) is a rabbi, civil and human rights activist,
radio host, television producer, actor, author and public speaker.


== Early life ==
Allen was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father was Jack Secher and his mother was Eleanor Steiner. He has one sister, Linda and three children, Judith, Debra and Adam. Allen grew up in Pittsburgh and Butler, Pennsylvania.
Allen's father Jack, graduated the University of Pittsburgh in 1925 and then from Columbia University in 1927 with a Master of Social Work. Jack performed social work at the Irene Kaufmann Settlement while at the University of Pittsburgh, and along with his wife ran a puppet theater at the Irene Kaufman Settlement. After graduating from Columbia University he opened and ran a series of restaurants and delicatessens in Pittsburgh.
Allen received a Bachelor of Philosophy from Brandeis University, was ordained by New York's Hebrew Union College in 1962, and earned his honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Hebrew Union College in 1987.
While attending Brandeis University Allen served as Eleanor Roosevelt's driver for five days in June 1955.


== Rabbi ==
Allen Secher served congregations in New York City, Mexico City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Montana between 1962 and 2013. In the 1960s, Secher pioneered the use of multi-media worship services at Temple Ahavat Shalom Northridge in Los Angeles.
After leaving his congregation in Los Angeles and before moving to Chicago, Secher started, ran and then closed an audio recording business for conferences and meetings. The business was first named Aviva and then renamed Butterfly Media Dimensions. The name Butterfly was in honor of ""I Never Saw Another Butterfly"", a collection of Jewish children's art and poetry from the Theresienstadt concentration camp.
In 1991, with his wife, Ina Albert, Rabbi Secher founded Makom Shalom, Chicago's first Jewish Renewal congregation, melding traditional and holistic paths (mysticism, meditation, gender equality) toward spiritual intimacy. He also served on the board of Aleph, the umbrella organization for Renewal Judaism.
Secher moved to Whitefish, Montana in 2000. In 2008, there were only about 1,000 self-identified Jews in Montana, a state with a population of about 900,000. For many years Secher was the only resident rabbi in Montana. He traveled between congregations in Whitefish, Missoula, Helena, Bozeman, Billings and Great Falls and was known as the ""Lone Rabbi of Montana"". Secher retired from congregational life in 2013.


== Civil and human rights activist ==
In the early 1960s, Secher was one of the Freedom Riders during the civil rights movement.
In August 1962 Dr. King put out a call to clergy to join him on a prayer pilgrimage to Albany, Georgia to support the civil rights movement. Dr. King had three requirements to participate—each person needed to have bail money, they could not have anything on their arrest record that would embarrass the civil rights movement and they all had to be committed to non-violence. Secher traveled to Albany and was part of a group of clergy that held a prayer service on August 28, 1962, in front of the Albany city hall. Four hundred onlookers watched as all 75 clergy were arrested and taken to 4 surrounding jails.
Dr. King wrote a ""Letter from the St. Augustine Jail"" to Rabbi Israel S. Dresner, urging him to recruit rabbis from a Central Conference of American Rabbis conference to come to St. Augustine, Florida and take part in the demonstrations being held in St. Augustine. Secher responded to the appeal and traveled to St. Augustine to participate in the demonstrations. Sixteen rabbis including Secher arrived and attempted to integrate the whites-only pool and restaurant with a group of civil rights organizers at the Monson Motor Lodge on June 18, 1964. The protesters and rabbis were arrested.
While in a segregated holding cell at St. John's County Jail, the clergy wrote a group letter titled ""Why We Went: A Joint Letter from the Rabbis Arrested in St. Augustine"". The day after the demonstration Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on June 19, 1964, after an 83-day filibuster.
In January 2005, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer appointed Secher to the Montana State Human Rights Commission, and reappointed him in 2009. In November 2011, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer appointed Secher to the Montana Arts Council.
In 2008 Secher, along with his wife Ina Alpert and two others co-founded Love Lives Here in Whitefish, a non-profit organization dedicated to diversity and equal treatment for all citizens, in response to some white nationalist film showings. Love Lives Here worked with other Whitefish community members to try and get the Whitefish City Council to enact diversity, tolerance and anti-discrimination legislation. In 2015 the Whitefish City Council approved an anti-discrimination ordinance.
In 2015, Richard B. Spencer, a spokesman for the ""alt-right"", lives part of the year in Whitefish. Richard and his mother Sherry Spencer own property in downtown Whitefish. Sherry claimed that a local Jewish realtor attempted to force her to sell her property because Richard was her son.
On December 16, 2016, the website The Daily Stormer asked its readers to unleash ""an old fashioned Troll Storm"" on Montana's Jews and provided contact details for five Whitefish residents, including Secher, his wife, two others and a local child. The post also included photographs of some of those residents, superimposed with a yellow Star of David bearing the word ""Jude"", the German word for Jew.
The events in Whitefish became part of a larger national dialogue about the alt-right, White nationalism and anti-semitism.
Secher also served on committees at North Valley Hospital in Whitefish and Kalispell Regional Medical Center in Kalispell, Montana.


== Radio and film ==
From 1967 to 1997, Allen A could be heard weekly on more than 450 Armed Forces Radio stations around the world. His internationally syndicated show, East of Eden, featured interviews, poetry, music, and perspectives on a wide variety of subjects. East of Eden was rated No. 1 in its category, and had a weekly audience of millions of listeners. Some guests included Ray Bradbury, Dalton Trumbo, Maya Angelou, John Cassavetes, Elie Wiesel and Rod McKuen. At one point in time it was the longest running show on the Armed Forces Radio Network.
In 2002 Secher hosted a radio show called Nice and Easy featuring Frank Sinatra on KOFI, a local station in Kalispell. In September 2007, Secher hosted a new show called You Must Remember This on Montana Public Radio. The show is a monthly hour-long program, that features performers, compositions, and composers of the Great American Songbook, music from the 1930s–1950s.
A longtime voice actor, Secher is the voice of The Dude Abides audio book.

Secher served as director of communications for the Jewish Federation of Chicago between 1980 and 1990 where he produced religious and ecumenical programming and independently produced television documentaries, receiving seven Emmy Awards for television production and direction. His Emmy Awards are:

Among his Emmy-winning documentaries was the PBS special, ""Choosing One’s Way: Resistance in Auschwitz-Birkenau"".

Secher was one of the rabbis featured in the documentary film The Rabbi Goes West, about a Chabad house rabbi in Montana.


== Interfaith ==
For 55 years, beginning with his first wedding on the day he was ordained, Rabbi Secher has officiated and co-officiated more than 2,000 weddings and other interfaith life cycle ceremonies. Dedicated to providing information and support to interfaith couples (both Christian and Jewish), he was a founder and longtime advisor to The Dovetail Institute, which at one time was the largest network for interfaith family resources in the nation.
In 1991, Secher and Father John Cusick (of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago) co-founded and served as advisors to The Jewish/Catholic Dialogue Group of Chicago, which provided support to interfaith couples who wished to explore a path in their interfaith marriage that permitted individual faith commitments without diminishing each partner's religious identification. In 1996, the organization also founded the Chicago Interfaith Family School, where Secher continues to serve as an advisor. Its mission includes supporting, educating, and offering general information to Jews and Catholics seeking to better understand one another.
During his Chicago years, Rabbi Secher was an active member of the National Conference of Christians and Jews (now known as the National Conference for Community and Justice).
Secher has spoken and written about interfaith issues.
Secher currently lives with his wife in Whitefish, Montana.

65,"Daniel Farhi (18 November 1941 – 23 August 2021) was a French liberal rabbi.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Farhi was born in Paris on 18 November 1941 to Samuel and Estréa Farhi, who were originally from İzmir, Turkey. During World War II, he was hidden with his sister, Françoise, by a Protestant family in Besançon, who were later honored as Righteous Among the Nations. 


=== Rabbinical career ===
He received semikhah in February 1966 and became rabbi of the Union Libérale Israélite de France from 1967 to 1977, succeeding André Zaoui.
On 2 June 1977, Farhi founded the Liberal Jewish Movement of France with Roger Benarosh and Colette Kessler. In 1981, he created the Jewish liberal newspaper Tenou'a. He strongly defended the idea that Halakha (Jewish law), must continue to be amended to keep up with societal changes so that the return of the Sanhedrin can be appropriately applied to modern times.
Farhi was active in dialogues with Christian and Muslim groups. He also worked to preserve the memory of the Holocaust and was a friend of Serge and Beate Klarsfeld. In 1975, he became an activist within the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France and subsequently helped to organize eight pilgrimages to Auschwitz. In 1990, Farhi became involved with La Paix maintenant and, in January 2010, founded the Centre Culturel Judéo-Espagnol/Al Syete, an association which brought together different Judeo-Spanish organizations.


=== Personal life and death ===
Farhi died in Nice on 23 August 2021 at the age of 79. He was the father of three children, including Rabbi Gabriel Farhi.

66,"Alysa Stanton (born August 2, 1963) is an American Reform rabbi, and the first African American female rabbi. Ordained on June 6, 2009, in August 2009 she began work as a rabbi at Congregation Bayt Shalom, a small majority-white synagogue in Greenville, North Carolina, making her the first African American rabbi to lead a majority-white congregation. Stanton converted to Judaism at age 24 and first studied and worked as a psychotherapist.


== Early life and education ==
Stanton was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and moved to Denver, Colorado, with her family at the age of 11. Although raised in the Church of God in Christ, when she was 24 Stanton converted to Judaism after considering several Eastern religions. She has said she was ""born Jewish—just not to a Jewish womb"". She earned her BA in psychology in 1988, an MA in education in 1992, from Colorado State University.


== Career ==
In her first career, Stanton was a psychotherapist. She specialized in grief counseling, and was asked to speak to people in Columbine after the 1999 high school massacre. Before preparing for the rabbinate, she sought to become a cantor, but heard that Jewish leadership positions were not available to women. When she finally saw a female cantor, she decided to pursue the studies necessary to become a rabbi.
Stanton graduated from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, a Reform Jewish seminary. She has said that she is not concerned with being the first Black woman to become a rabbi, ""I try not to focus on being the first. I focus on being the best—the best human being, the best rabbi I can be."" ""If I were the 50,000th, I'd still be doing what I do.... Me being first was just the luck of the draw.""
In August 2009, Stanton became the rabbi of Congregation Bayt Shalom, a small majority-white synagogue in Greenville, North Carolina, making her the first African American rabbi to lead a majority-white congregation. The congregation's president said that the fact that Stanton is African-American and a woman had nothing to do with the decision to hire her: ""I'm very proud of my community. [Stanton's being a woman or being Black] never came up in conversation. Obviously, we all know that's unusual but when she got on the pulpit during her visit, it was totally comfortable."" In 2011, the congregation decided not to renew her contract, which expired July 31, 2011.

67,"Eugen Mittwoch (4 December 1876 – 8 November 1942) was the founder of Modern Islamic Studies in Germany, and at the same time an eminent Jewish scholar.


== Biography ==
Coming from an old Orthodox Jewish family, Mittwoch was born in Schrimm, Prussian Province of Posen, Imperial Germany (now Srem in Poland). He initially wanted to become a Rabbi. During his studies in Berlin he discovered Islamic studies and did his doctorate with Eduard Sachau.
During World War I, Mittwoch was the head of the German Nachrichtenstelle für den Orient from 1916 until 1918. After the agency initially employed people who advocated Jihad and violence against the Western powers, Mittwoch hired more liberal and cosmopolitan writers and intellectuals for the Nachrichtenstelle such as the Swiss Max Rudolf Kaufmann (Mittwoch hired him for the Nachrichtenstelle, after he was arrested, briefly imprisoned and deported from Turkey because Turkish intelligence had found letter of Kaufmann criticizing German-Turkish militarism and jingoism), the Social Democrat Friedrich Schrader and the Zionist Nahum Goldmann. Schrader and Kaufmann were correspondents for the Jewish-owned liberal Frankfurter Zeitung and close associates of Paul Weitz, one of the sharpest critics of German collaboration with the genocidal politics of the Young Turks.
In the 1920s, Mittwoch was the leading orientalist in Germany, and the founder of a more politically oriented, modern science of Middle East Studies, in contrast to the traditional philologic, apolitical approach very much influenced by Goethe.

In the early 1920s, Mittwoch was involved in the planning of the Hebrew University and its School of Oriental Studies. He was invited to Jerusalem to receive a professorship of Arabic for one year, but apparently refused the invitation.
Since he was a leading specialist on Ethiopian languages world-wide, Mittwoch did not lose his academic position in 1933 immediately like almost all his Jewish colleagues in Germany did at that time. This had to do with a special intervention by Mussolini with Hitler on behalf of Mittwoch. Because of their colonial activities in Ethiopia, the Italians were extremely interested in Mittwoch's knowledge and research.  Mittwoch was very active on behalf of the Ethiopian Jews (Falasha), and was also one of the first German Jews who could speak fluent Ivrit.
Starting in 1933, Mittwoch used his ""privileged"" position in Germany (he continued to receive his salary as a German professor until the beginning of the war) on behalf of the Jewish community, he became head of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in Berlin. However, in 1938, after Kristallnacht, also Mittwoch had to emigrate, and moved via Paris to London with his immediate family. During the last 18 months of his life, he worked for the Middle East department of the British Ministry of Information under the leadership of Ernst Jäckh.
The remaining family, including his mother, who was murdered in Bergen-Belsen, were murdered in the Shoah. A daughter Adele Mittwoch (1925–2011) was a renowned psychotherapist in England, specializing in group psychotherapy, another daughter Agnes (born 1926) later immigrated to Israel (made aliyah) and was a university lecturer in Jerusalem. The oldest daughter, Ursula, born 1924, was professor for human genetics at the UCL (University of London) and, in 2014, was still scientifically active and celebrated her 90th birthday in her old institute.
Mittwoch died in London, England, UK.

68,"Baruch ""Burry"" Chait (born 1946) is an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, musician and composer. He is rosh yeshiva of the Israeli high school Maarava Machon Rubin in Matityahu.


== Early life ==
Baruch Chait was born to Esther and Moshe Chait, a rabbi and future rosh yeshiva (dean) of Yeshivath Chafetz Chaim of Jerusalem. He studied under Henoch Leibowitz, rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim of Forest Hills, New York. As a youth counselor, Chait was involved with various summer camps in New York's Catskill Mountains, including Torah Vodaas, Camp Munk and Sdei Chemed. There, he learned to use music as an alternative means to educational growth.


== Career ==


=== Music ===
Having been influenced by Shlomo Carlebach, at the age of 16 or 17 Chait began composing Jewish religious melodies. Later, in 1975, Chait would go on to collaborate with Carlebach and Abie Rotenberg on an album, Ani Maamin (lit. 'I Believe').
In 1967, Chait co-founded a band called The Rabbis' Sons along with Label Sharfman, Itzy Weinberger and Michael Zheutlin—all of the bandmates being sons of rabbis. The band's debut album, Hal'lu, featured some of Chait's first compositions, including Rabos Machshovos (lit. 'Many Are The Thoughts') and Mi Ho-ish (lit. 'Who Is The Man'), which he adapted from The Book of Psalms. The progressive sound that the band produced received a somewhat lukewarm response from Leibowitz due to its folk roots (the band's instruments consisted mostly of guitars, a relatively new innovation for Jewish music of the time) but Chait's father approved. Chait later founded Kol Salonika. He has since composed hundreds of Jewish religious songs that have wide popularity and appeal, publishing dozens of records. He wrote Kol Ha'Olam Kulo while performing for Israel Defense Forces soldiers during the Yom Kippur War. The song quickly became an Israeli standard, having been covered by Ofra Haza. On February 27, 2022, Chait was inducted with the inaugural class of the Jewish Music Hall of Fame.


=== Education ===
In 1987, Chait founded Maarava Machon Rubin, a yeshiva high school in Matityahu, West Bank. The school combines religious and secular studies at a level allowing completion of matriculation exams. The school caters to the Haredi sector, and this fact initially brought Chait, who described himself as a ""small man"", into conflict with ostensibly greater Haredi leaders who normally oppose such innovation in Jewish education. However, he has since secured the private blessing of a number of leading rabbis in this endeavour.


=== Writing ===
Chait has written a number of children's educational books on Jewish topics, together with illustrators Gadi Pollack and Yoni Gerstein. Many of his books go under the name of the HaLamdan HaKattan (small scholar) series.
Some of his books include:

The 39 Avoth Melacha of Shabbath
The Ehrenhaus Middos Series:
The Incredible Voyage to Good Middos
The Lost Treasure of Tikun Hamiddos Island
The Terrifying Trap of the Bad Middos Pirates
Shadow Pirates — The Wheel Is in Your Hands (2022)

My Friends - The Alef Beis
Torah Town
The Desert Diary: The Historic Journey of a Nation with Divine Faith Through a Wilderness to the Promised Land
Ha'achadim Ve'ha'asafim (Hebrew)

69,"Danny Rich is a  Labour councillor in the London Borough of Barnet. He was, until 2020, the Senior Rabbi and Chief Executive of Liberal Judaism in the United Kingdom.


== Early life and education ==
Danny Rich was born in London, and attended Hearnville Primary School and Sir Walter St. John's Grammar School, where he was head boy. Following his A-levels in German, History, and Government and Politics, he worked for the London Fire Brigade before entering Manchester University to study Politics and Modern History, doing his undergraduate thesis on The Palestinian Experience in Jordan: 1948–1970 and maintaining an active role in student politics, being twice elected chairperson of Manchester University Students Union. During this time, he also served as a visiting lay minister for Leicester Progressive Jewish Congregation, and as a teacher/service leader at Manchester Reform Synagogue. In 1984, Rich began rabbinical training at Leo Baeck College, a privately funded rabbinical seminary in the UK for Liberal and Reform rabbis. While there, he continued to serve at Leicester Progressive Jewish Congregation, and began teaching at North Western Reform Synagogue (Alyth Gardens). He served as an assistant to Rabbi Julia Neuberger at South London Liberal Synagogue, as part-time minister to Kingston Liberal Synagogue, and as student rabbi to Hull and South Hampshire Reform communities, before returning to serve as the full-time Rabbi at Kingston in 1988, where he was ordained in 1989.


== Kingston Liberal Synagogue and public service ==
As Kingston Liberal Synagogue's first full-time rabbi, Rich served until 2004, when he was appointed emeritus rabbi. During his period of service at Kingston, he co-founded and chaired the Kingston Interfaith Forum, a group to promote communication and understanding between the faith groups in the borough. He also served as the director of Kadimah Summer Camp from 1990–2005. In 1996, he was appointed as a Justice of the Peace (magistrate) in the Kingston Court, presiding over cases until the court's closure in 2011, when he presided over the court's last trial. Rabbi Rich also serves as a prison, hospital and hospice chaplain. He is currently Jewish chaplain to Her Majesty's Prison Coldingley, and formerly to the open prison Latchmere House until the prison's closure in 2011, as well as for Kingston Hospital, and Oaklands National Health Service (NHS) Trust. He also served as Jewish mental health chaplain to Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. As a part of his involvement as a prison chaplain, he received a diploma in criminology from the Scarman Centre for the Study of Public Order (Leicester University) in 2001. He is a former Trustee of Mental Aid Projects a former Governor at Hinchley Wood Junior School.


== Liberal Judaism ==
In 2004, Rich was named as the chief executive of Liberal Judaism, a progressive Jewish movement founded in the UK in the early part of the 20th century. Rabbi Rich was preceded in this role by Harriet Karsh, who had assumed the role from her predecessor, Rabbi Dr. Charles Middleburgh. Prior to this appointment, Rich had served as the chair of the Rabbinic Conference of Liberal Judaism, a board composed of all the Rabbis serving Liberal synagogues in the UK that meets regularly to discuss and rule on rabbinic matters, determining courses of action or principles of faith.
He is on the board of governors at Leo Baeck College, where he had served previously as the director of the college's Apprenticeship, Internship and Mentoring Program. A regular in the media, Rich has made frequent appearances on the BBC, Sky TV, ITV and in the Jewish and national press.


=== Interfaith affiliations ===
Many of Rich's affiliations reflect a position of the promotion of interfaith understanding. He is the UK regional representative for the World Union for Progressive Judaism (WUPJ). He also holds a Certificate in Jewish/Muslim relations from the Woolf Institute, Cambridge. He is an organiser and frequent contributor to Scriptural Reasoning, an organisation that promotes shared scriptural readings between Jews, Christians, Muslims and members of other faiths. He is one of the presidents of the Council of Christians and Jews, He is a co-founder of the Surrey Three Faiths Forum, and in 2011 became a founding member of the Council of Imams and Rabbis.


=== The JFS case ===

In 2009, a case was brought before the High Court where a 12-year-old boy, referred to in the case as M, was denied entry to the Jewish Free School (JFS) because, although his father was born a Jew and both his father and mother actively practised the Jewish faith, the mother had converted to Judaism in a non-Orthodox synagogue, failing to meet the school's criteria for the child being Jewish. As a spokesperson for Liberal Judaism (which recognizes patrilineal as well as matrilineal Jewish descent), Rich was actively vocal in supporting M's case, stating that JFS, as a state-funded school, had an obligation to be open to all forms of Judaism. The school was found to be in violation of the Race Relations Act, and is now required to admit its students on the basis of Jewish faith, rather than by the maternal blood line. Following the court's decision, Danny Rich, along with Liberal Judaism chairman Lucian J. Hudson, issued a statement in The Jewish Chronicle in support of the ruling, stating that JFS had ""risked the Jewish community being portrayed as more concerned with petty, territorial squabbles than providing the best of Jewish education to the widest number of Jews"".


=== Same-sex marriages ===
Rich is a vocal proponent in favour of legalising same-sex unions. In 2005, Liberal Judaism under the direction of Rich became the first mainstream religious movement in the UK to publish an official liturgy for same-sex commitment ceremonies. In February 2013, Rich presented evidence to the House of Commons Public Bill Committee looking into the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, reiterating Liberal Judaism's stance on the issue, stating that ""although Liberal Judaism respects the right of other religious movements to decline to conduct marriages which go against their teachings, and to have this right protected in law, it also seeks, in the name of freedom of religion, the right to conduct marriages which it sees as legitimate, and as an important pastoral service to its members.""


=== Considered Engagement controversy ===
In January 2012, Rabbi Rich drew criticism for sharing a debate panel with an anti-Israel activist. He stood by his decision to do so, citing Liberal Judaism's policy of Considered Engagement, a policy where the movement's chief executive, chairman and other national officers review invitations to participate in events based on their goals, even if the hosting or participating organisation are not in accord with the policies of Liberal Judaism.


=== The confirmation of Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis ===
When Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis was named Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth in December 2012, Rich issued a statement welcoming his appointment, but said that the hardest part of the job would be recognising that the position ""no longer represents a large section of the community"".


=== Expanded religious education in the UK school system ===
In October 2013, A Curriculum Framework for Religious Education in England was issued by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales, stating is part that, ""All children need to acquire core knowledge and understanding of the beliefs and practices of the religions and worldviews which not only shape their history and culture but which guide their own development."" Rich wrote a column in Haaretz in support of the publication, calling for comprehensive religious education in both single-faith and secular schools, stating that ""religious education has never been more important"".


=== The ""pickling"" of Judaism by the Charedi ===
The 2012 statistics report for Britain's Jewish Community, issued in November 2013 by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, noted a ""natural increase"" in Britain's Jewish population, with specific mention of Britain's Charedi (Orthodox) community, who were responsible for four out of every ten Jewish births and more than three in ten weddings. In response to these numbers, Rich issued remarks that have generated some controversy, stating that the Orthodox community ""pickled"" Jewish tradition rather than preserving it, by refusing to engage with the outside world.


=== The admission of Syrian refugees into the UK ===
In January 2014, Rich took part in a delegation of rabbis who delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street, calling on the government to allow Syrian refugees into the UK. He issued a statement that read in part, ""For Jews, Jewish teaching demands that we find ways of alleviating the suffering and in the name of our faith we call on the British government to allow Syrian refugees into the UK.""

70,"Abraham Grünbaum (1930 – June 7, 2001) was an orthodox rabbi and leader of a yeshiva in Bnei Brak. His death is one of the currently unsolved murder cases in Switzerland.
Grünbaum survived World War II in a work camp in Siberia, while his parents have been murdered in his native Poland.


== Murder and aftermath ==
Grünbaum died on June 7, 2001 in Zürich.
On a visit to Switzerland, Grünbaum was shot near 10:00 PM on the Weberstrasse road near the Hallwyl square when he was on his way to the maariv prayer. The two bullets, fired from at distance of less than two meters, hit Grünbaum in the upper body. An envelope containing more than 1000 Swiss Francs in donations, as well as his airline tickets, were still found on his body.
An involvement of the German right-wing NSU terror group in this murder has been debated, but as of 2017, there has not been any proof of such a connection.

71,"Uri Regev is a lawyer and rabbi of the Reform movement of Judaism in Israel, and an active civil rights and religious pluralism advocate. Currently he serves as the President and CEO of “Hiddush – For Freedom of Religion and Equality”, a trans-denominational nonprofit organization aimed at promoting religious freedom and equality in Israel, a partnership between Israeli Jews and World Jewry, founded in 2009.


== Biography ==
Uri Regev was born in Tel Aviv in 1951 to a secular family. As a child he had no interest in religion. His first contact with the Reform movement was in 1967, when he joined a student delegation to Jewish communities in the United States. After returning to Israel, he joined the small Reform youth movement.
Regev studied law at Tel Aviv University Law School and went on to practice law. In the late 1970s, he began studying at the Reform movement′s rabbinical school, Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, where he was ordained in 1986. He served in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) as an assistant legal advisor in the Gaza Strip and Sinai and as military prosecutor for the Israeli Navy. He retired from military service with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
Regev lives in Jerusalem with his wife, Garri. They have a son and daughter.


== Social activism ==
Regev has been executive director of the Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), the political arm of the Reform movement in Israel, and President of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. Israeli newspaper Haaretz described him as a ""charismatic figure who speaks eloquently and often sharply and has an impressive work output,” and credits him and Oli Sloam with changing the Reform Movement′s face in Israel and making IRAC the most active institution within the movement, turning it “into a factor that both the religious and political establishment cannot ignore”.
Regev won in the Supreme Court some of the recent landmark cases regarding Religion and State in Israel, including the recognition of Reform and Conservative conversion performed abroad. The long legal battle for the recognition of Reform conversion and the political struggle against the Conversion Law led to the appointment of the Ne'eman Commission, which recommended the creation of a common conversion institute for all three streams of Judaism - a recommendation that was accepted by the Chief Rabbinate.
Regev is a founding member of B'Tselem, the organization monitoring human rights in the occupied territories, and has served on the boards of many Jewish organizations, including the World Zionist Organization, the Jewish Agency, Rabbis for Human Rights, and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.

72,"Harold Samuel Kushner (April 3, 1935 – April 28, 2023) was an American rabbi, author, and lecturer. He was a member of the Rabbinical Assembly of Conservative Judaism and served as the congregational rabbi of Temple Israel of Natick, in Natick, Massachusetts, for 24 years. 
Kushner gained widespread recognition for his many popular books that simplify complex theological ideas for both Jewish and non-Jewish readers. He received numerous awards, including the Christopher Award in 1987 and the Jewish Book Council's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007. His most prominent works include When Bad Things Happen to Good People, delving into human suffering, divine kindness, and theodicy following his son's death, and When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough, exploring existential themes of life's purpose and the pursuit of fulfillment.
Considered to be one of America's most prominent rabbis, Kushner was known for his Reconstructionist views and for his ideological progressiveness within the Conservative movement. He argued against the notion of an omnipotent, interventionist God, and instead focused on God's role in offering comfort and solace to those who suffer.


== Early life and education ==
Harold Samuel Kushner was born to Conservative Jewish parents Julius and Sarah (née Hartman) Kushner in Brooklyn, New York City. When he began elementary school, his family relocated to the Crown Heights neighborhood. Kushner was an avid fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers in his early years. While his mother was a homemaker, his father owned Playmore Publishing, a shop at Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street that specialized in selling children's books and toys, primarily Bible stories. Julius had hoped that his son would take over the business someday, but Harold did not believe he possessed the same level of business acumen as his father. 
After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, he attended Columbia University, where he initially intended to major in psychology but later switched to literature after being taught by Mark Van Doren, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. At Columbia, Kushner's extracurricular positions included working for Jester of Columbia and WKCR, where he eventually became the director of sports broadcasting, and serving as the president of the student Zionist organization.
Despite having a strong religious upbringing, Kushner had no plans to become a rabbi until he joined an evening program at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. He became certain about his calling to be a rabbi during his junior year at Columbia. He completed his bachelor's degree in religious education in 1955, and after completing his master's degree in the social and philosophical foundations of education in 1960, he enrolled full-time at the seminary, where he was ordained that same year. Kushner received his doctorate in Hebrew literature in 1972. He also completed a year of graduate work at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and held teaching positions at Clark University and the Rabbinical School of the JTS.


== Rabbinical career ==
Following his rabbinic ordination, Kushner went to court to request the waiver of his military exemption. He served for two years as a first lieutenant in the Army's Chaplain Corps at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. After his discharge from the military, Kushner returned to New York and served as an assistant rabbi at Temple Israel in Great Neck from 1962 to 1966. 
In 1966, Kushner assumed the position of rabbi at the 450-family congregation Temple Israel in Natick, Massachusetts. He fulfilled the role of congregational rabbi there for 24 years while also being a member of the Rabbinical Assembly, the ""clerical arm"" of the Conservative movement. From 1972 to 1974, he served as the president of the New England Region of the Rabbinical Assembly. Initially serving as Temple Israel's full-time rabbi, he shifted to part-time in 1983 to allocate more time for writing and in 1990, he transitioned to full-time writing and lecturing. The synagogue deemed Kushner, who was 55 years old at the time, too young to be appointed as rabbi emeritus, so he was bestowed the title of rabbi laureate in 1983. The title, held by only a few American rabbis, underlined his commitment to maintaining an enduring connection with both his congregants and the rabbinate. He attended the synagogue until his death.
Kushner's presence in the Conservative movement was described as ""inescapable"". In 2001, he co-authored Etz Hayim: A Torah Commentary, the new official Torah commentary of the Conservative movement, in collaboration with Chaim Potok. The comprehensive work comprises four layers of commentary, encompassing insights on Conservative observance of Jewish law and traditional and contemporary interpretations of scripture (midrash), curated by Kushner.
Kushner spoke at the interfaith prayer service for the second inauguration of Bill Clinton. He was also a eulogist at the state funeral of Ronald Reagan in the Washington National Cathedral in 2004, where offered a reading from the Book of Isaiah.


== Writing ==
With the backing of Rabbi Ira Eisenstein, the founder of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, Kushner released his inaugural book in 1971 under the title When Children Ask About God: A Guide for Parents Who Don't Always Have All the Answers. Rather than reinforcing the notion of God as an all-knowing and all-powerful creator, he aimed to foster a healthy skepticism and encourage questioning as a means of developing a meaningful religious faith. The book primarily targeted parents and aimed to address the concerns of people who were seeking a new Jewish belief system more in line with their broader worldview.
Kushner is best known for his international best-selling book on the problem of evil, When Bad Things Happen to Good People, published in 1981. Written following the death of his son, Aaron, from the premature aging disease progeria, it deals with questions about human suffering, God, omnipotence, and theodicy. Kushner aimed to assist individuals in maintaining their belief in God's benevolence despite experiencing personal tragedies. His book offers a fresh interpretation of the Book of Job, suggesting that while God may not have the power to prevent suffering, God provides solace to those who are afflicted. His contemporary interpretation of theodicy in the book laid the groundwork for the modernist theological literature within the Conservative Jewish community, alongside works by Elliott N. Dorff, Neil Gillman, Harold M. Schulweis, and David Wolpe. The book resonated with readers across religions and was translated into at least 12 languages. Its success propelled it to the top of The New York Times Best Seller list, and established Kushner as a well-known author and commentator. In 1991, it tied for the ninth position with four other books in the Book of the Month Club's list of the top ten books that had the most significant impact on American lives, based on a nationwide survey. The book was described as ""arguably one of the most widely read books written by a rabbi in centuries"" and as ""one of the most widely read Jewish books of our generation"" by Neil Gillman. Its popularity was partly attributed to Protestant clergy members promoting it in their sermons and distributing copies to their congregations. Four million copies had been sold by the book's 20th anniversary. 
In 1986, Kushner published When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough: The Search for a Life That Matters, delving into existential themes of life's meaning and individual pursuit of happiness within the context of Ecclesiastes. Its title was deemed an ""apt summary of Ecclesiastes"". Kushner's goal was to dissect the unfulfillment experienced even by achievers, asserting that ""What we miss in our lives, no matter how much we have, is that sense of meaning."" He rejected the notion of a singular answer to life's complexities and contended that such answers are found in daily experiences, relationships, and the quest for integrity. Central to his argument was Ecclesiastes, which he called ""the most dangerous book in the Bible"" for its call to contemplation over blind worship, as Kushner contended that life's richness emerges from thoughtful engagement, emphasizing that an unfulfilled life is more daunting than death itself. The book earned praise as a ""useful spiritual survival manual"" from The Washington Post and received the 1987 Christopher Award for its ""contribution to the exaltation of the human spirit.""
Who Needs God, published in 1989, argued for the ongoing relevance of God in a world characterized by unprecedented human achievements. As with Kushner's previous works, Reconstructionist views were apparent in his attempt to make room for religious life and the notion of God without the belief in an all-powerful creator. He aimed to bridge the gap between religious fundamentalism and atheism, highlighting that organized religion's greatest offering is not theology but rather the comfort and support of a spiritual community. Kushner also asserted that the existence of God endows individuals with the ability to perceive holiness in the world and attain a greater sense of purpose.
Kushner authored several other well-received theological books, such as How Good Do We Have to Be? and To Life!. Works such as When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough, Who Needs God? and How Good Do We Have to Be? reached a wide readership of millions. In 2007, Kushner received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jewish Book Council. 
Carolyn Hessel, director of the Jewish Book Council, attributed Kushner's success to his ability to appeal to everyone regardless of their background. Burton Cooper, a professor of theology at the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, argues that Kushner's popularity and significance arise from his skill in reaching individuals with a ""modern consciousness"", a perspective informed by science, and resonating with their longing for religious faith. 
In the fall of 2001, Kushner achieved his sixth best-seller with Living a Life That Matters, focused on Jacob from the Old Testament, the sole figure with a complete biography in the Bible. He examines Jacob's complex moral choices, such as deceiving his father to secure his blessing. He interprets Jacob's encounter with an angel as an internal struggle, symbolizing the conflict within his soul and his progression towards integrity. While Kushner's stance suggests Jacob's victory through loss, the Torah presents an alternate perspective, depicting Jacob as the undisputed winner.

Kushner's response to Simon Wiesenthal's question of forgiveness was included in a revised 1997 edition of the book The Sunflower: On the Possibilities and Limits of Forgiveness, alongside those of 45 other leading intellectuals and commentators. Wiesenthal's inquiry emerged from a real-life scenario during the Holocaust, when he confronted a dying Nazi soldier who sought absolution for his heinous deeds, prompting the question: Can such profound wrongdoing be forgiven? Kushner conveyed the essence of forgiveness as follows:
Forgiving is not something we do for another person, as the Nazi asked Wiesenthal to do for him. Forgiving happens inside us. It represents a letting go of the sense of grievance, and perhaps most importantly a letting go of the role of victim. For a Jew to forgive the Nazis would not mean, God forbid, saying to them ""What you did was understandable, I can understand what led you to it and I don't hate you for it."" It would mean saying ""What you did was thoroughly despicable and puts you outside the category of decent human beings. But I refuse to give you the power to define me as a victim. I refuse to let your blind hatred define the shape and content of my Jewishness. I don't hate you; I reject you."" And then the Nazi would remained chained to his past and to his conscience, but the Jew would be free.
Kushner was an editor of the journal Conservative Judaism from 1980 to 1984. 
Kushner frequently used examples from TV shows and movies in his teachings and writings to connect with his audience, as he believed many people are more familiar with these cultural references than with the Bible, although he expressed concern over the semi-literacy of the Bible and found it surprising when people were not familiar with biblical stories.


== Views ==
Kushner, affiliated with Conservative Judaism, championed progressive concepts within the movement while deeply influenced by Mordecai Kaplan, his teacher and the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, whom he regarded as the most influential thinker in American Jewish history. During a speech to the Rabbinical Assembly in 1980, he commented that the Conservative movement had faced an ongoing crisis regarding the authority of halakhah (Jewish law) since its inception. He emphasized that the goal of Conservative rabbis was to demonstrate that leading a religious life in the modern era could be fulfilling, without imposing strict observance on less practicing Jews. Paraphrasing Jewish theologian Martin Buber, Kushner also once stated that ""people want less theology and more religion."" He rejected the definition of religion ""as an individual experience"", emphasizing its communal aspect.
Informed by the teachings of Kaplan, Kushner was a proponent of Jewish religious naturalism. Discarding the notion of an omnipotent God, he proposed that God lacks complete dominion over the universe and is not culpable for evil. Within this Reconstructionist framework, he identified two core life forces: the randomness of nature and purposeful divine actions. He rejected the notion of God causing suffering as punishment, advocating instead for a God who shares in human pain, as evidenced by God's name ""I am with you"" in the Book of Exodus. Viewing God as a source of empathy and love, Kushner once recalled being concerned that during Yom Kippur, his synagogue's congregants focused too much on guilt and did not give themselves the chance to experience God's forgiveness. His aphorism ""forgiveness benefits us more than the person we forgive"" was one of many adopted by religious leaders of various faiths. Drawing from the Reconstructionist tradition, Kushner asserted that God shouldn't be perceived as a distant entity in space, emphasizing that the question of God's existence doesn't necessarily revolve around the concept of a heavenly population. 
Kushner's writing and ideas were popular among Christians, but traditional Jews held mixed opinions. He once expressed, ""I always thought Judaism was at its best when it not only looked at text, but when it looked at people."" Kushner's approach, rooted in a focus on human needs, occasionally led him to reinterpret Jewish theology for emotional solace. This resulted in some Orthodox Jews feeling defensive of traditional Jewish teachings and accusing him of promoting un-Jewish ideas. In When Bad Things Happen to Good People, Kushner reconciled Jewish beliefs in God's omnipotence and benevolence constraining God's influence over random hazards in life. He likened God to a benevolent watchmaker who created the world and its natural laws. This perspective portrays God as taking pride in his creation while permitting it to operate within these established laws, including the occurrence of random challenges. This implies that God intentionally refrains from complete control over every aspect of life, enabling individuals to navigate and respond to various situations while supporting them only with his presence. This view contradicts traditional Jewish teaching and led to criticism from Orthodox Jews, although Kushner himself acknowledged that he may have been wrong about God. Literary critic and journalist Ron Rosenbaum was not convinced by Kushner's argument in the book, describing Kushner's position as ""diminishing God to something less than an Omnipotent Being – to something more like an eager cheerleader for good, but one decidedly on the sidelines in the struggle against evil.""
In line with Kaplan's influence and Reconstructionist theology, Kushner perceived the Torah as a fully human creation that, while acknowledging its human origins, serves to commemorate significant religious experiences in life. He sometimes expressed doubt about the reliability of individuals who claim to have heard divine messages, and cited the Binding of Isaac as a problematic narrative that contradicts fundamental religious tenets. The story tells of Abraham going to sacrifice his son, Isaac, as an offering to God in obedience to a divine directive. Although Kushner believed that Abraham heard the message, he was skeptical that God actually said it.


== Personal life ==
In 1960, Kushner married Suzette Estrada and moved to Massachusetts. Estrada died in 2022. The couple had a son named Aaron, who died of progeria at the age of 14, a daughter named Ariel, and two grandchildren. Kushner's brother Paul was a rabbi in Bellmore and Merrick on Long Island, and died in 2019.
In 1995, Christian inspirational group The Christophers included Kushner in their list of ""50 individuals who have made a positive impact on the world over the past 50 years."" He was the recipient of six honorary doctorates.
Kushner moved into a senior residence in Canton, Massachusetts in 2017. He died on April 28, 2023, at age 88.

73,"Henry Barnston (August 23, 1868 – December 11, 1949) was a British-born American rabbi.


== Life ==
Barnston was born on August 23, 1868, in Dover, England, the son of Rabbi Isidore Jules Barnstein and Eva Mendelsohn. He was born Henry Barnstein, but he changed his surname to Barnston during World War I to make it sound less German.
Barnston attended private school in Dover. He graduated from the University of London with a B.A. in 1890, Montefiore College in Ramsgate with a B.A. in 1893, and the University of Heidelberg with an M.A. and a Ph.D in 1896. He preached before the Sephardic Congregation in London and was associated with the Jewish Domestic Training Service. He was ordained a rabbi in London in 1897 and received his rabbinic diploma from Haham Moses Gaster. He worked as a Hebrew instructor at St. Augustine's Church School in Kilburn and as a German instructor for the London School Board. 
Seeking a more conductive atmosphere to practice liberal Judaism, Barnston immigrated to the United States in 1900 and became rabbi of the Reform Congregation Beth Israel in Houston, Texas. Under Barnston, a new temple was built that was described by one source as the finest in the American Southwest and the congregation grew tenfold. He became rabbi emeritus in 1943, serving in that position until his death. He was a founder of the Jewish Welfare Service, the Texas Kallah of Rabbis, the Community Chest, and the Houston Symphony Society (which later became the Houston Symphony Orchestra. He was also president of the local B'nai B'rith and the Texas Association of Rabbis. He didn't take a public stand on civil rights, although he joined with the First Methodist Church in an unprecedented act of ecumenical defiance against the Ku Klux Klan. He was a member and supporter of the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, although he resisted pressure from his congregation to be more active in the organization. 
Barnston was active in interfaith work throughout Texas, serving as a leader in the National Conference of Christian and Jews and as a civilian chaplain to U.S. Army camps in the Houston area during both World Wars. He conducted memorial services in virtually every church in the Houston area, including for Queen Victoria and William McKinley in the Christ Church Cathedral. He was a founder and secretary of the Houston Art Museum, vice-president of the Social Service Federation of Houston, and a director of the Public Library Association, the Family Service Bureau, the Humane Defense League, the Texas Prison Relief Association, and the Planned Parenthood Association of Houston. He delivered baccalaureate addresses at several colleges, including the Rice Institute in 1926 and the Hebrew Union College and the Southeastern Louisiana College in 1942. 
Barnston wrote Targum of Onkeles in 1896, collaborated with Gustaf Dalman on Chaldäisches Wörterbuch and Aramäische Dialektproben, and assisted Emil Friedrich Kautzsch with his dictionary of the Targum. He lectured for the Jewish Chautauqua Society at Tulane University and the University of Louisiana. He contributed to The Jewish Quarterly Review, The Menorah Journal, The Jewish Chronicle, The American Hebrew, the Israel, the Reform Advocate, The Jewish Encyclopedia, and the Encyclopedia of Jewish Knowledge. 
Barnston was a member of the American Asiatic Society, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, Pi Tau Pi, the Ministerial Alliance of Houston, and the Houston Rotary Club. In 1910, he married Ethel Irene Kennard of Kensington, England. Their children were Vivienne Adele and Alfred Jules. Ethel died in 1917. In 1920, he married Ethel's sister Ruth Nina. They had one child, Jack Dudley. Alfred was ordained a rabbi by his father in 1947 and by 1949 was rabbi of the Union Temple of Brooklyn. 
Barnston died in Hermann Hospital on December 11, 1949. He was buried in the Beth Israel Mausoleum.

74,"Henry Isaac Sobel (9 January 1944, in Lisbon – 22 November 2019, in Miami) was a Portuguese-American Reform rabbi, and was president of the Congregação Israelita Paulista (CIP), a major Jewish congregation in São Paulo, Brazil.


== Biography ==
Son of Ashkenazi Jews who fled the Nazi persecution during the World War II (Belgian father and Polish mother), Sobel was born  in Lisbon, Portugal. While he was an infant his family moved to New York City where he grew up and was eventually ordained a reform rabbi in 1970. In the same year, he accepted an invitation to be the rabbi at Congregação Israelita Paulista and established himself in São Paulo, Brazil. In his own words, it ""made possible my actuation in the social and politic fronts and gave me the chance of engaging myself"". As of 2007, he had two colleagues sharing the rabbinate, Rabbi Michel Schlesinger and Rabbi Yehuda Busquila. 
During the 1970s and 1980s Sobel had an extraordinary role in protecting the human rights in Brazil (at that time governed by the military). Along with Catholic Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns and others, Sobel showed great courage in denouncing the assassination of journalist Vladimir Herzog by right wing military in Brazil.
He had also a great role in promoting inter-religious dialogue in Brazil and elsewhere by cultivating excellent relations with Catholic dignitaries, including the Pope John Paul II. During more than 30 years, Sobel was recognized as an informal leader of the reform Jewish community in São Paulo.
Sobel has one daughter, Alisha, born in São Paulo in 1983.


== U.S. arrest and hospitalization ==

On March 23, 2007, Sobel was arrested in Palm Beach, Florida, accused of shoplifting US$680 worth of neckties. He was released on a $3,000 bail and returned to São Paulo. He initially denied the accusations and then requested a suspension from his position at CIP.
On March 30, Sobel was admitted to Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. According to the doctors, due to ""an episode of mood disorder, represented by a lack of emotional control and altered behavior."" The hospital also reported that he had been taking large quantities of drugs to treat severe insomnia that ""cause potential states of mental confusion and amnesia."" On April 2, Sobel gave a brief press conference at the hospital. ""I don't know where to start,"" he began. ""I am taking relatively strong medications. Regarding what happened, it is very hard for me to explain the inexplicable. I do not have scientific and psychological knowledge to understand, explain and, much less, justify what occurred, but one thing I know: the Henry Sobel who committed that act is not the Henry Sobel you know."" He ended saying: ""I want to close with an apology, and I also want to make a commitment. I want to apologize for the  distress that I caused, especially for having taken medication without a medical prescription. I want to apologize for the distress that I caused everybody, and I want to make a solemn commitment: I intend to keep on defending all the moral and ethical values that I have always stood up for, as a Jew, a man and a rabbi.""


== Death ==
Sobel died of cancer on 22 November 2019, in Miami, Florida.

75,"Herbert Mark Baumgard (August 3, 1920 – April 15, 2016) was the founding Rabbi of Temple Beth Am and was one of the leading interpreters of Liberal Judaism. Named in his honor after his passing are ""The Rabbi Herbert Baumgard Learning Hub"" in the Green Library at Florida International University and ""Rabbi Baumgard Road,"" which runs in front of the temple in which he founded.


== Early life ==
Baumgard was born in Norfolk, Virginia to Sarah and Samuel, who was a tailor. He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1941 where he was a member of Hillel and Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. Next he attended Columbia Law School, where he was captain of the debate team. It was during World War II, while serving as a chaplain's assistant, that Baumgard realized he wanted to become a rabbi.


== Career ==
He was ordained at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in 1950 and earned his doctorate in Hebrew Letters in 1956. Baumgard began his rabbinical career at Temple B'nai Israel in Elmont, New York.
In 1955, he moved with his family down to Miami and was the founding rabbi of Temple Beth Am, located in Pinecrest, Florida. Being inspired by Stephen Samuel Wise and Mordecai Kaplan, his idea was to shift Beth Am to a synagogue, while emphasizing education. He served as the head rabbi there for over 30 years. Upon retiring in 1987, he had built it from 55 families meeting at a church to 1,700 families on a 14-acre campus that included a day school and a youth basketball league, becoming the largest Reform congregation in the Southeast.
Rabbi Baumgard's other notable positions of leadership include serving as President of the Synagogue Council of America, the largest Jewish organization including all the branches of Judaism; the President of the Community Relations Board of Miami-Dade County;  President of the Alumni Association of the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion; and President of the Dialogue Chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. 
He was among the Jewish leaders to meet with Pope John Paul II during his 1987 visit to Miami.
Specializing in the study of the Hebrew prophets, he was the author of several books, including The Miracles of Jesus and the Miracles of the Early Hebrew Prophets, Loving What is Close, Judaism and Prayer: Issues of Faith, and Finding My Way to God.

77,"Arthur Ocean Waskow (born Arthur I. Waskow; 1933) is an American author, political activist, and rabbi associated with the Jewish Renewal movement.


== Education and early career ==
Waskow was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He received a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1954 and a Ph.D. in American history from University of Wisconsin–Madison. He worked from 1959 to 1961 as legislative assistant to Congressman Robert Kastenmeier of Wisconsin. He was a senior fellow at the Peace Research Institute from 1961 through 1963. He joined Richard Barnet and Marcus Raskin and helped to found the Institute for Policy Studies in 1963, and he served as resident fellow until 1977.
In 1968 Waskow was elected an alternate delegate from the District of Columbia to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. His delegation was pledged to support Robert F. Kennedy, and after Kennedy's assassination, Waskow proposed and the delegation agreed to nominate Reverend Channing Phillips, chair of the delegation, for President, the first Black American to be nominated at a major party convention.
Waskow was a contributing editor to Ramparts magazine, which published his ""Freedom Seder"" in 1969. The ""Freedom Seder"" was the first widely published Passover Haggadah that intertwined the archetypal liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Ancient Egypt with more modern liberation struggles such as the Civil Rights Movement and the women's movement.
Through the 1960s, Waskow was active in writing, speaking, electoral politics, and nonviolent action against the Vietnam War. After 1963, he participated in sit-ins and teach-ins and was arrested many times for protests against racial segregation, the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union's oppression of Jews, South African apartheid, and the Iraq war. In 1967, he was the co-author, with Marcus Raskin, of ""A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority,"" a widely influential manifesto in support of those who resisted the military draft during the Vietnam War. In 1968, he signed the ""Writers and Editors War Tax Protest"" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.


== Religious initiatives ==
Since 1969, Waskow has taken a leadership role in the Jewish Renewal movement. In 1971, he helped found the Fabrangen Havurah in Washington, DC.  He notes that his experience at Fabrangen inspired his 1978 book Godwrestling. From 1982 to 1989, Waskow was a member of the faculty of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, where he taught courses on contemporary theology and practical rabbinics. He also taught in the religion departments of Swarthmore College, Temple University, Drew University, and Vassar College.
He founded The Shalom Center in 1983 and serves as its director. At first the center primarily addressed the threat of nuclear war; as the times demanded,  it turned its focus toward ecology and human rights, then opposition to attacks on American Muslims and to the US War in Iraq, and more recently the dangers of global warming and the climate crisis. In 1993, Waskow co-founded ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal. Between 1993 and 2005, he performed research, wrote, and spoke on behalf of ALEPH.
Waskow was ordained a rabbi in 1995 by a transdenominational beth din (rabbinical court) made up of Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, with Lubavitch Hasidic lineage; Rabbi Max Ticktin, ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative); Rabbi Laura Geller, ordained by the Hebrew Union College (Reform); and feminist theologian Dr. Judith Plaskow.
Waskow's best-known books include Godwrestling, Seasons of Our Joy, Down-to-Earth Judaism: Food, Money, Sex, and the Rest of Life, and Godwrestling — Round 2: Ancient Wisdom, Future Paths. With Sr. Joan Chittister, OSB, and Murshid Saadi Shakur Chisti, he co-authored The Tent of Abraham. With Rabbi Phyllis Berman he co-authored Tales of Tikkun: New Jewish Stories to Heal the Wounded World, A Time for Every Purpose Under Heaven: The Jewish Life-Spiral as a Spiritual Journey, and Freedom Journeys: Tales of Exodus and Wilderness Across Millennia. He was the managing co-editor of Trees, Earth, and Torah: A Tu B'Shvat Anthology, and he edited Torah of the Earth: 4,000 Years of Jewish Thought on Ecology (2 vols).


== Views and public honors ==
Waskow took pioneering roles in supporting the full presence and equality of women and of LGBTQ people in all aspects of Jewish life and religion, including same-sex marriage; in mobilizing opposition in the Jewish and general communities to the Vietnam and then the Iraq wars; beginning in 1969, after his first summer-long sojourn in Israel and visits to the Occupied Territories, urging a two-state peace settlement between Israel and Palestine; in treating the planetary climate and extinction crises as a profound concern of Torah, necessitating action by the Jewish community; and in urging the Jewish community to treat the increasing concentration of top-down power by small minorities of the ultra-rich and by giant corporations as the reappearance of ""pharaoh"" in modern American life. In 2011, he (with Daniel Sieradski) co-inspired the creation of ""Kol Nidre in the Streets"" as a part of Occupy Wall Street. Since spring 2012 he has been a member of the Coordinating Committee of the US National Council of Elders, a network of veteran activists of the crucial justice and peace movements of the mid-20th century who are continuing their nonviolent social action and are partnering with the new movements of the 21st century.
Waskow pioneered in the development of Eco-Judaism in theology, liturgy, daily practice, and activism—through his books mentioned above as well as Torah of the Earth: 4,000 Years of Ecology in Jewish Thought and his essay on “Jewish Environmental Ethics: Adam and Adamah,” in Oxford Handbook of Jewish Ethics and Morality. Other activities included the Green Menorah organizing project of The Shalom Center, the Interfaith Freedom Seder for the Earth and climate-focused public actions drawing on traditional liturgies for Tu B’Shvat, Passover, Tisha B’Av, Sukkot, and Hanukkah, and running as a candidate for the World Zionist Congress on the Green Zionist Alliance slate. In 2010, Waskow joined in founding the Green Hevra, a network of Eco-Jewish organizations, and served on its stewardship committee till 2013. In 2012 he became a member of the steering committee of Interfaith Moral Action on Climate. He is also a practitioner of nonviolent civil disobedience who has been arrested in climate protests in the US Capitol, at the White House, and at Philadelphia conclaves of fracking corporate leaders.
In 2007, Newsweek named him one of the fifty most influential American rabbis. In that year also, the Neighborhood Interfaith Movement of Philadelphia presented him its Rev. Richard Fernandez Religious Leadership Award, and the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation presented him its Peace and Justice Award. The Forward named him one of America's ""Forward Fifty,"" creative leaders of American Jewish life. In 2014 he was honored by T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights with its first Lifetime Achievement Award as a Human Rights Hero. In 2015, The Jewish Daily Forward named him one of ""America's most inspiring rabbis"".
In 2017, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College awarded Waskow its once-a-year honorary doctorate of humane letters.
Waskow taught as a Visiting Professor in the religion departments of Swarthmore College (1982–83, on the thought of Martin Buber and on the Book of Genesis and its rabbinic and modern interpretations); Temple University (1975–76 on contemporary Jewish theology and 1985–86, on liberation theologies in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam); Drew University (1997–1998, on the ecological outlooks of ancient, rabbinic, and contemporary Judaism and on the synthesis of mysticism, feminism, and social action in the theology and practice of Jewish renewal); Vassar College (1999 on Jewish Renewal and Feminist Judaism); from 1982 to 1989 on the faculty of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (contemporary theology and practical rabbinics); and in 2005 on the faculty of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute for Religion (the first course on Eco-Judaism in any rabbinical seminary).
Beginning with his first arrest in 1963, in a walk-in to end racial segregation by a Baltimore amusement park, and continuing through his arrest at the US Capitol in 2016 in a protest calling for more democratic election processes in the US — getting what he called ""Hyper-Wealth"" out of election campaigns and ending voter suppression aimed at disfranchising especially racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, the young, and the old— and most recently with arrests in Philadelphia at the ICE offices in protest of US governmental hostility to refugees and immigrants—he was arrested about 26 additional times, each time for a non-violent protest against racism, militarism, polluting the Earth, or interference with democratic process. He claimed each as a public honor and religious act, in the spirit of the remark by Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel after the Selma March for voting rights: ""I felt as if my legs were praying.""
He continues to be a prolific writer and speaker in the public sphere on the topic of social justice through a Jewish Renewal lens. The Arthur Ocean Waskow Papers (1948-2009)] are archived at the American Jewish Historical Society. More recent papers are archived at the University of Colorado in Boulder.

79,"Abram Wolf Edelman (a.k.a. Abraham Edelman) (1832-1907) was a Polish-born American rabbi. He was the first rabbi in Los Angeles, California, serving as the first rabbi of Congregation B'nai B'rith, from 1862 to 1885. It is now known as the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.


== Early life ==
Abram Wolf Edelman was born on August 17, 1832, in Kutno, Poland. He had a classic Jewish education. He married and immigrated to the United States with his wife in 1851, the year he turned nineteen.

According to Harris Newmark, another pioneer of the Newmark family, Edelman later resigned because he was an Orthodox rabbi and the congregation was slowly becoming Reform. But his services were not stricto sensu Orthodox. They included ""mixed seating, a mixed choir, Conformation, English prayers and English sermons.""

80,"Chaim Potok (February 17, 1929 – July 23, 2002) was an American author, novelist, playwright, editor and rabbi. Of the more than a dozen novels he authored, his first book The Chosen (1967) was listed on The New York Times’ bestseller list for 39 weeks and sold more than 3,400,000 copies, and was adapted into a well-received 1981 feature film by the same title.


== Biography ==
Herman Harold Potok was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Benjamin Max (died 1958) and Mollie (née Friedman) Potok (died 1985), Jewish immigrants from Poland. He was the oldest of four children, all of whom either became or married rabbis. His Hebrew name was Chaim Tzvi (חיים צבי). He received an Orthodox Jewish education. After reading Evelyn Waugh's novel Brideshead Revisited as a teenager, he decided to become a writer (he often said that Brideshead Revisited is what inspired his work and literature). He started writing fiction at the age of 16. At age 17 he made his first submission to the magazine The Atlantic Monthly. Although it was not published, he received a note from the editor complimenting his work. He attended high school at Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy, Yeshiva University's boys high school.
In 1949, at the age of twenty, his stories were published in the literary magazine of Yeshiva University, which he also helped edit. In 1950, Potok graduated summa cum laude with a BA in English Literature.

After four years of study at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America he was ordained as a Conservative rabbi. He was appointed director of LTF, Leaders Training Fellowship, a youth organization affiliated with Conservative Judaism.
After receiving a master's degree in English literature, Potok enlisted with the U.S. Army as a chaplain. He served in South Korea from 1955 to 1957. He described his time in South Korea as a transformative experience.  Brought up to believe that the Jewish people were central to history and God's plans, he experienced a region where there were almost no Jews and no anti-Semitism, yet whose religious believers prayed with the same fervor that he saw in Orthodox synagogues at home.
Upon his return to the U.S., he joined the faculty of the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. Potok met Adena Sara Mosevitzsky, a psychiatric social worker, at Camp Ramah in Ojai, California, where he served as camp director from 1957 to 1959. They were married on June 8, 1958. In 1959, he began his graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania and was appointed scholar-in-residence at Har Zion Synagogue in Philadelphia. In 1963, the Potoks were instructors at Camp Ramah in Nyack.  Also in 1963, he began a year in Israel, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on Solomon Maimon and began to write a novel.
In 1964, the Potoks moved to Brooklyn, where Chaim became the managing editor of the magazine Conservative Judaism and joined the faculty of the Teachers’ Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary. The following year, he was appointed editor-in-chief of the Jewish Publication Society in Philadelphia and later, chairman of the publication committee. During this time, Potok received a doctorate in philosophy from  the University of Pennsylvania. In 1970, the Potoks relocated to Jerusalem and then returned to Philadelphia in 1977.
After the publication of Old Men at Midnight, Potok was diagnosed with brain cancer. He died at his home in Merion, Pennsylvania on July 23, 2002, aged 73.


== Literary career ==
In 1967, Potok published The Chosen, which won the Edward Lewis Wallant Award and was nominated for the National Book Award. Potok wrote a sequel to The Chosen in 1969, entitled The Promise, which details the issues of the value and identity between Orthodox and Hasidic Jews. This book won the Athenaeum Literary Award the same year of its publication. Not long afterward the Jewish Publication Society appointed him as its special projects editor. In 1972, he published My Name is Asher Lev, the story of a boy struggling with his relationship with his parents, religion and his desire to be an artist. In 1975, he published In the Beginning. From 1974 until his death, Potok served as a special projects editor for the Jewish Publication Society. During this time, Potok began translating the Hebrew Bible into English. In 1978, he published his non-fiction work, Wanderings: Chaim Potok’s Story of the Jews, a historical account of the Jews. Between 1978 and 1989, Potok contributed articles to Moment Magazine. Potok described his 1981 novel The Book of Lights as an account of his experiences in Asia during the war. He said “it reshaped the neat, coherent model of myself and my place in the world.”
His novel The Chosen was made into a film released in 1981, which won the most prestigious award at the World Film Festival, Montreal. Potok had a cameo role as a professor. The film featured Rod Steiger, Barry Miller, Maximilian Schell and Robby Benson. It also became an  Off-Broadway musical and was adapted as a stage play by Aaron Posner in collaboration with Potok, which premiered at the Arden Theatre Company in Philadelphia in 1999.
Potok's 1985 novel Davita's Harp is his only book featuring a female protagonist. In 1990, he published a sequel to My Name is Asher Lev titled The Gift of Asher Lev. It won the National Jewish Book Award for Fiction. Potok wrote many plays, among them Sins of The Father and Out of The Depths. In 1992, Potok completed another novel, I am the Clay, about the courageous struggle of a war-ravaged family. His 1993 young adult literature The Tree of Here was followed by The Sky of Now (1995) and Zebra and Other Stories (1998).


== Literary influences ==
Potok's parents discouraged his writing and reading of non-Jewish subjects. Nevertheless, he spent many hours in the public library reading secular novels. Potok cited James Joyce, Thomas Mann, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ernest Hemingway, and S. Y. Agnon as his chief literary influences. Many of his novels are set in the urban environments in New York in which he himself grew up. While not Hasidic, Potok was raised in an Orthodox home. In the book My Name is Asher Lev, Asher Lev wants to be a painter, which causes much conflict with his father who wants him to do something else, much as Potok did during his childhood. Asher decides to become a painter, which upsets his family. Potok went into writing and painted in his free time. Potok said he related to Asher Lev more than any of his other characters.


== Legacy ==
Potok has had a considerable influence on Jewish American authors. His work was significant for discussing the conflict between the traditional aspects of Jewish thought and culture and modernity to a wider, non-Jewish culture.  He taught a highly regarded graduate seminar on Postmodernism at the University of Pennsylvania from 1993 through 2001.
He bequeathed his papers to the University of Pennsylvania. The university houses a collection of Potok correspondence, writings, lectures, sermons, article clippings, memorabilia and fan mail. One of his admirers was Elie Wiesel, who wrote to Potok saying he had read all his books ""with fervor and friendship"".

85,"Herbert Tarr (1929 – November 18, 1993), born Herbert Targovik, was an American Reform rabbi who left his pulpit to become a novelist and humorist, believing he could reach more people that way because ""religion is basically out of touch with people.""


== Biography ==
Tarr was born in Brooklyn, New York.  He attended Brooklyn College, graduating magna cum laude. Later he earned advanced degrees in a number of academic areas, including philosophy, contemporary literature and drama, from institutions including Herzliah Hebrew Teachers Institute-Jewish Teachers Seminary, Columbia University, and the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.
He was ordained as a rabbi in 1955 and entered the United States Air Force to serve as a military chaplain. This experience inspired some of his first novel, The Conversion of Chaplain Cohen.  In it, he explore how a young civilian rabbi was ""converted"" to the role of a military chaplain who helps men and women of all faiths.
Following his service as a chaplain, Tarr served as the rabbi of a synagogue in Buffalo, New York. In 1960, he moved to a congregation in Westbury, New York. In 1963 he decided to leave the pulpit to pursue a career as a novelist full-time, believing that he could be more effective in terms of reaching others that way.
He said, ""[R]eligion is basically out of touch with people"". He wanted to help people ""contemplate their lives,"" to consider ""how they fit into the world around them"". He wrote with humor, through stories that carried values and ideals. As the playwright Brendan Behan wrote in a review for his first novel, The Conversion of Chaplain Cohen (1963), while Tarr ""has us busy laughing, he's throwing sermons at us behind our backs"".
A Kirkus Review of his work So Help Me God! affirmed Tarr's mixture of humor and serious messages, noting that

Tarr's easy-going and companionable rambles through American Jews' spiritual and secular preoccupations (Heaven Help Us!, 1968) continue to amuse, but here he explores some deeply serious and disturbing matters such as Vietnam, the plight of Soviet Jewry, and the essence of religion.
Tarr used his experiences as a pulpit rabbi and military chaplain to inform his writings, and also used his rabbinic knowledge. For example, his novel, A Time for Loving, is based on the Biblical book, The Song of Solomon (also known as the Song of Songs).
Tarr wrote one play, ""The New Frontier,"" a comedy that held tryouts in New Haven and Philadelphia, with the hope that it would make it to Broadway.
Tarr died of liver cancer at the age of 64 on November 18, 1993, at the home of his sister, in Roslyn Heights, New York.


== Legacy ==
The North Shore Institute for Adult Jewish Learning, a joint educational program serving 18 synagogues and one Jewish community center in the Long Island area, was renamed the Herbert Tarr North Shore Institute for Adult Jewish Learning in his memory. The 2012 season of the Jewish Studies and Lectures Program opened at Temple Judea in Roslyn, New York in October 2012.
Tarr's 1979 novel, So Help Me God!, published seven years after the 1972 ordination of Sally Priesand includes a rabbinical student Isaca Zion. Zion is an important figure in the novel, but is not portrayed as the protagonist. By the end of the novel, Zion receives ordination. It is thought that Zion is the first fictional woman rabbi in contemporary American fiction.

== Biography ==
Aryeh Leib Frumkin was born in Kelmė, Lithuania in 1845. He immigrated to Eretz Yisrael (Mutassarifate of Jerusalem, Syrian provinces of the Ottoman Empire at the time) before the First Aliyah in 1871. His great-grandson, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, wrote, ""My great-grandfather Rabbi Arye Leib Frumkin went to Israel in 1871; his father had settled there twenty years earlier. His first act was to begin writing his History of the Sages in Jerusalem, chronicling the Jewish presence there since Nachmanides arrived in 1265.""  While there he founded the settlement of Petah Tikva in which he built the first house and helped to drain the malaria-ridden swamps. His planting of the first tree there is emblazoned on the seal of the municipality and there is a street named after him.
Frumkin moved to London, England in 1893 after an Arab attack on Petah Tikva. In London's East End he operated a family wine shop. He later returned to Petah Tikva.

88,"Marc Schneier (born January 26, 1959) is an American rabbi and president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding. Schneier previously served as vice-president of the World Jewish Congress.


== Career ==
According to Tablet, Schneier ""is a polarizing figure. To his supporters, [he] is a peerless institution-builder and community leader. To his detractors, he's indulged an appetite for fame and wealth while plowing his way through five marriages, destroying fragile bonds of trust with his congregants in the process.""
In 1999, Schneier authored the book Shared Dreams: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Jewish Community which is the first reference to the Letter to an Anti-Zionist Friend, an open letter allegedly written by Martin Luther King Jr. which was later determined to be a hoax.

 Schneier has also worked together with Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR), the American Muslim advocacy organization, which the organized American Jewish community has long viewed as ""out of bounds"" for its alleged ties to the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas and its broader anti-Israel activity and rhetoric.
The Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) decided in 2010 to investigate Rabbi Schneier for breaching the code of ethics by carrying on an extramarital relationship. The RCA executive committee voted to expel Schneier in June 2015.
In 2013, Schneier co-authored with Imam Shamsi Ali the book Sons of Abraham: A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims.
In 2018, Tablet reported that Schneier helped connect the Qatari government to Jewish American lobbyist Nicolas Muzin. In 2017 Qatar hired Nick Muzin to improve its relations with the Trump Administration and the Jewish American community. Muzin's work reportedly included arranging meetings between Qatari officials and leaders of Jewish and pro-Israel advocacy groups.

Schneier married his 5th wife, on October 6, 2013. For his 50th birthday, his fourth wife, Tobi Rubinstein-Schneier, arranged for a 400 lb. endangered Asian lion to be donated in his honor at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo.  The lion was renamed ""Rabbi Marc"".
Schneier married his 6th wife, Simi Teitelbaum,  in 2017.
In February 2018, it was reported that the State of Florida has ordered Schneier pay $5,000 a month for $64,594 in unpaid child support he owes to his third wife for the care of their then-19 year old son.
He is the son of Rabbi Arthur Schneier.

91,"Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer (March 25, 1930 – December 29, 1993) was an American Conservative rabbi who became a recognized international human rights activist while living and working in Argentina from 1958 to 1984, during the period of the ""Dirty War"" in the 1970s. He was elected by president Raúl Alfonsín to be one of the members of the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons.
After the restoration of democracy in 1983, Meyer was awarded the nation's highest honor, the Order of the Liberator General San Martín, by the new president.
In Argentina Meyer also led the congregation Comunidad Bet El and founded Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano, a Conservative Judaism rabbinical school in Buenos Aires that has trained generations of Spanish-speaking rabbis.
Rabbi Meyer returned to the United States in 1984 and that year became rabbi of Congregation Bnai Jeshurun in New York City. He was called to revive the congregation of the oldest Ashkenazi synagogue in the city.
He was one of those honored by president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to those who fought for the restoration of democracy in Argentina.


== Early life and education ==
Marshall Theodore Meyer was born in Brooklyn New York in a Jewish family and raised in Norwich, Connecticut. He attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1952. After meeting Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, he enrolled in the Jewish Theological Seminary. Heschel became his mentor and spiritual guide, whose influence and example profoundly affected Meyer's career as a religious leader. After receiving ordination in 1958, Meyer was called as a rabbi to the Congregación Israelita de la República Argentina (Templo Libertad), where he worked for two years. He then left and started the Comunidad Bet El in Buenos Aires, Argentina.


== Career in Argentina ==
Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer used his energy and charisma to contribute to the Argentine Jewish community. He founded the Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano, a rabbinical school in Buenos Aires that soon became the center of Conservative Judaism in Latin America. In it were ordained dozens of Spanish-speaking rabbis who served communities in Argentina, Latin America, and the rest of the world.
Rabbi Meyer led Comunidad Bet El, a congregation that became a model of many other Conservative synagogues, both in Argentina and Latin America. The congregation established its own day-school.
During the years of the military regime of 1976–1983, Rabbi Meyer became a strong critic of the military government and its violations of human rights. He worked to save the lives of hundreds of people who were being persecuted by the regime. He visited political prisoners in jails. He worked with the Israeli government to free the renowned journalist, Jacobo Timerman, who had been persecuted, imprisoned and subjected to extended house arrest. Timerman dedicated his memoir of that time, Prisoner Without A Name, Cell Without A Number (1981), to the rabbi. Timerman wrote that Meyer had ""brought solace to Jewish, Christian and atheist prisoners"". Meyer additionally founded the Movimiento Judío por los Derechos Humanos, an organization that played a key role in the fight for human rights in Argentina.
In 1983, when democracy was restored in Argentina, the newly elected president, Raúl Alfonsín, recognized the work of Rabbi Meyer by awarding him the highest Argentine decoration, Order of the Liberator General San Martín. Rabbi Meyer returned the United States in 1984.


== Later period ==
After a short stay at the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University) in Los Angeles, in 1984 Rabbi Meyer accepted the position of rabbi at Congregation Bnai Jeshurun in New York City. It is the oldest Ashkenazic synagogue in the city, and he had the mission of reviving the congregation.
Between 1984 and 1993, B'nai Jeshurun became a thriving liberal community that attracted thousands of Jewish people. The challenging theology espoused by Rabbi Meyer, the spiritually uplifting religious services, an agenda that emphasized social action as a central part of the synagogue's principles, ecumenical work with Christian and Muslim clergy, and a leading role in the peace movement in regard to the Arab–Israeli conflict, led to the rapid growth of the congregation. It became a model for many other synagogues in the United States.

93,"Rabbi Pinchas Mordechai Teitz (1908–1995) was a rabbi, teacher, author, and innovator in creating a modern Torah community in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He excelled in his family's tradition of caring for Jews across the globe in any challenges they faced. A mikvah he built in 1938, a day school he founded in 1941 that grew to more than 900 students, adult education courses that he initiated, the welcome he gave to displaced persons after WWII and to Jews who came from Russia, all became a model for other leaders to implement in their cities and towns.


== Early life ==
Mordechai Pinchas Teitz was born on 8 Tammuz-July 7, 1908 in Subat, Latvia. The first name had a long history in the family, going back to Rav Mordechai Yoffe, the Levush. ‘Pinchas’ was the title of the parshah in the week of his bris. He became known by this name, which proved to be appropriate as he acted for the welfare of the Jewish community throughout his adult life. But he signed legal documents in Hebrew ‘Mordechai Pinchas,’ and his passport from Latvia read ‘Morduchas Pinchas Taic.’
His father's name also raised questions. At birth he was named Binyamin Yaakov, with Rabinovich as his last name.  The family wanted to avoid his being taken into the Russian army. A boy who was an only child was exempt from the draft. The parents of an only son, Avraham Teitz, did not inform the authorities when their little boy died. They gave his passport to Binyamin Rabinovich, who now became Avraham Teitz, and was called ‘Avraham Binyamin’ or ‘Binyamin Avraham’ within the community.   In his last years, when he did not have to fear that the Tsar's army would come after him, he signed letters with his original name, Binyamin Yaakov.
Another source of confusion was that Pinchas's grandfather was a Yoffe. But when he married Rivkah Rabinovich, he took on her surname because her family had become renowned. Her father, Rav Binyamin Rabinovich, was the courageous rabbi of Vilkomir who made a powerful man stop sending Jewish boys to the army. Her brothers were the twins Rav Eliyahu David and Rav Zvi Yehuda, who added ‘Te-omim’ to the family name. The initials of the first twin's name, aleph daled reish taf, formed an acrostic, ‘Aderet.’ His daughter married Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Hakohen Kook, who later became the first chief rabbi in Palestine. When his wife died in the third year of their marriage, Rav Kook married her first cousin, and became doubly related to the Rabinoviches. For Pinchas's father, the youngest in the family and orphaned when he was nine, there was a special closeness with his uncles and their families; he lived with them when he was home from the yeshiva. He married Shaina Sira, a daughter of Rabbi Moshe Mishel Shmuel Shapiro, the rabbi of Rogova, Lithuania, and the author of noted scholarly works. Her ancestor was the Maharshal, Rav Shlomo Luria, known for his accurate rulings in Torah law.  Her sister Leah married Rabbi Ben-Zion Zilber. Leah's son, Yitzchak Yosef, and Shaina Sira's son, Pinchas, first met in 1972 in Tashkent; two World Wars and the Iron Curtain had kept them apart until then.
Rabbi Binyamin Avraham Teitz was the rabbi in Subat for the mitnagdim and the hassidim. Living quarters for the family were between a shul for one group at one end, and for the other group at the second end. The five sons and five daughters learned that everyone was a valued member of the community, united with one rabbi. Years later visitors to Elizabeth commented that in most places the residents would erect separate synagogues for different factions, but Rabbi Teitz kept them united.
In 1914, Rabbi Eliyahu Akiva Rabinovich, a brother of Rabbi Binyamin Avraham, urged him to come with Shaina Sira and their children to Poltava, Russia, where he was the rabbi.  The danger in Latvia was that the Russians and the Germans - whichever army reached a city first - took the rabbis as a hostage to prevent any aid being given to the enemy.  Rabbi Eliyahu Akiva edited and published Hamodia, a newspaper, and HaPeles, a journal. Pinchas and his brothers set type on a machine their uncle had bought in Warsaw in order to print professional editions. The young Pinchas learned from his uncle to speak and write without fear about communal issues, and to act. If people were fleeing to Poltava, his uncle cared for them.  Rabbi Eliyahu Akiva Rabinovich died before Passover in 1917, while he was preparing to bake matzoh for the refugees.
In 1921, the family had to flee again, this time from Communists who were intent on destroying Torah education and Torah life. In Latvia, their father became the rabbi in Livenhof. In the nearby city of Dvinsk were brilliant Torah scholars—Rabbi Yosef Rosen (the Rogatchover) and Rabbi Meir Simchah HaKohen, the author of Or Samei’ach and Meshekh Chokhmah.  By the time Pinchas turned fourteen, he had met outstanding scholars and courageous, caring leaders, many of them his relatives. He learned from them how to be a rabbi.


== Education ==
Pinchas learned in a yeshiva in Ponevez, then in Riga.  When he came home for vacation, he found that boys who were not in school were in danger. He was only fourteen and a half years old, yet he took the initiative and founded a heder for them.
He studied for six years at the yeshiva in Slabodka, where he and Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky began a life-long friendship. He was ordained in 1931 by Rabbi Yosef Zusman Hayerushalmi, Av Beis Din of Kovna, and by Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch, Rosh Yeshiva of Telz. His education in community-building began with an invitation from Rabbi Mordechai Dubin (1889-1956) to help in his successful campaign for a seat in the Latvian legislature, the Sejim.  Dubin set the example of helping everyone, Gentile and Jew, observant and non-observant.
In 1931, when the doctor recommended that he spend time at home to recover from an emergency appendectomy, Pinchas took a daily train ride to Dvinsk to study Yoreh Deah, particularly the laws of kashrut, with Rabbi Yosef Rosen (the Rogatchover).


== Career ==
Rav Pinchas Teitz became friendly with Shimon Wittenberg, also a representative to the Sejim, and Avigdor Balshanek, the head of Agudath Israel in Latvia. He became Secretary of Agudath Israel and traveled around the country to establish a heder in every town. His powers of analysis, memorable phrasing, and ability to engender enthusiasm in an audience led to his being asked to speak at many gatherings. He met the Lubavitcher Rebbe (1880-1950) at the border when the Communists released him from Russia to Latvia; he helped the Rebbe establish a yeshiva in Riga. He met Rav Yehezkel Abramsky (1886-1976) at the train station in Riga when the Communists released him from prison. The prison officials had wanted to humiliate Rav Abramsky by removing his beard. Rav Teitz arranged a minyan in an apartment where the rav could stay while his beard grew back.
He edited Unzer Shtimme, ""Our Voice,"" a Yiddish newspaper in Riga; he headed a religious youth movement that he named  Yavneh; he was the rabbi of a small town.
At his sister's wedding the heads of the Telz Yeshiva observed his organizational skills and heard him speak.  They asked him to accompany Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Bloch (1895-1955) on a fund-raising trip to North America. He promised his father that he would return to Latvia after the trip. He prepared by learning at the yeshiva for a semester.
Rabbi Bloch and Rabbi Teitz arrived in New York on November 3, 1933, the thirtieth day after the passing of Rabbi Elazar Mayer Preil, a distinguished Telz alumnus.  He had been the rabbi of the Orthodox community in Elizabeth, New Jersey, a close friend of the Bloch family, the author of scholarly works, and had contributed essays under the pen name A.L. Tzihan to Hapeles, the journal Pinchas's uncle had edited and published in Poltava decades earlier.


=== Marriage ===
Rabbi Preil had written in his will that if the man his oldest daughter, Basya, would marry will be suitable, he should become the rabbi of Elizabeth. Basya and Pinchas hesitated to meet since people spoke about a solution to the problem of finding a rabbi, not about the relationship of a young couple. Then Rav Bloch introduced them to each other. In autumn 1934 they became engaged and on January 13, 1935, the 9th of Shvat, they married; she would teach her husband English.


=== Rescuing Jews from Europe ===
Their trip to Latvia and Lithuania to meet the family took them across Germany; fear of the Nazis was evident. Rabbi Teitz spoke wherever he was invited about the danger of Hitler carrying out his plans and the need to leave Europe. When the couple returned to America, he started the process of immigration for his family. He was able to save one brother and his parents. A brother-in-law came to the United States in 1938, then went back to accompany his wife and young children; they waited too long.
He had worked in Europe in the 1930s on an economic boycott of Germany, but the Nazis used it for propaganda against the Jews. Now that he was in the United States, he met with government officials, including senators, to propose paying $100 for each Jew who would be permitted to leave the lands that the Nazis had conquered. But anti-Semitism was rampant; one politician told him that helping Jews would hurt his chances in the next election. He joined Va’ad Hatzalah, sending food and trying to rescue people.
In 1941, Jewish life in Europe was being destroyed; Torah education and observance would have to grow in America. He started a day school where a high level of Jewish and secular knowledge would be attained. He instituted nursery for 3-year-olds, kindergarten at 4, and primer at 5, where children learned to read Hebrew and English, each one at an individual pace. He wanted children to enjoy learning through Shabbos parties, making a seder, singing, performances, and daily recess in a large playground. Opposition to a day school was intense; the word ‘yeshiva’ could not be used until Dr. Samuel Belkin, president of Yeshiva University from 1943-1975, made it part of the American vocabulary.  The assumption was that only a big city with a large Jewish population could sustain a yeshiva.  Elizabeth was the third small community to start a school.
After the war he went to England, France and D.P. (Displaced Persons) camps to help survivors find refuge. He listed the school and synagogues in Elizabeth as places where they could be employed. The savings account that contained money he had raised to construct a school building became assurance that none of the survivors would request welfare. In a booklet published by Bobover Hassidim they note that Rav Teitz helped the Rebbe with the paperwork and got him into the United States.
For 30 years he was the treasurer of Ezras Torah, a charity to support Torah scholars; he worked closely with Rabbi Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, who headed the charity. When a project to provide housing in Jerusalem for Torah scholars was about to go bankrupt, he raised the funds to complete it in 1977.


=== Building Torah in America ===
In 1947, he built a modern synagogue with perfect sight lines and acoustics for the men's and women's sections; it was located in a beautiful neighborhood, an example of the rabbi's principle that Orthodoxy should be first-rate in every way.
In 1951, he opened a new building for the school, around the corner from the synagogue; the school and synagogue were now named the Jewish Educational Center, JEC; visitors borrowed educational materials, mission statements, publicity flyers, and architectural plans.
In 1955, two projects combined: a yeshiva high school for boys opened; the classrooms were in a new synagogue in an area that had been fields a few years earlier, but was now the place to build spacious homes. The synagogue had 6 steps leading down to the men's section, and 6 steps up to the women's section, demonstrating that men and women shared in separating for prayer.
In 1963, he opened the Bruriah High School, the first yeshiva high school for girls in New Jersey.
In 1965, the boys’ high school moved into a new building with a beit midrash-study hall, labs, a gym, a library; it was connected to the elementary school building.
In 1972, Bruriah moved into a new building with a mikvah for the new neighborhood.
While he was fundraising and, together with his wife, creating a community where every member was important, he took responsibility for original projects:
In 1958-1964, he testified before congressional committees and state legislatures on the humane qualities of kosher slaughter; he debated on the radio with those who wanted to ban shechitah. For a book about the confrontation with death in America, Dr. Michael Lesy reported on the contrast between an ordinary packinghouse in Omaha, Nebraska and the kosher slaughterhouse that Rav Teitz permitted him to visit. He was impressed with the rabbi's explanation of shechitah and with the shochet's attitude to his work as a mitzvah.  He thought ""in Omaha, the kill was rational and brutal. Here it’s religious and humane.""
In 1960, he served on the board of Yavneh, the newly formed National Association of Religious Jewish Students.
In 1961, he assisted students at Princeton in renting a house where they could pray, have Torah classes, and eat kosher food.  He signed the lease for the house, spoke to officials at the university, invited Milton Levy, a member of the Elizabeth community who wanted to support this initiative (and who donated all the furniture and outfitted the kitchen), and gave several classes to the students.


=== Russia ===
Between 1964 and the 1980s, Rav Teitz traveled to the USSR twenty-two times to assure the 3 million Jews who were caught behind the Iron Curtain that their brothers and sisters cared for them, and to bring siddurim, chumashim, haggadot for Passover, etrogim and lulavim for Sukkot, and kosher cured meat. He published a siddur called Kol Yisrael Haverim, All Jews Are Friends, which contained all the information needed for a Jewish life:  how to read Hebrew, how to pray, the text for a ketubah (marriage contract), how to make tefillin, mezuzot, and tzitzit. He added pictures of fruits, vegetables, grains, plants used for spices, with their names in Hebrew, Russian, and Latin/English (sometimes together, sometimes Latin alone), grouped together according to the blessing on each. Young people met in secret groups to learn from the siddurim how to read and speak Hebrew; several   began to observe mitzvot. He met with government officials to stop the destruction of cemeteries and to get permits to build an ohel, a canopy, for the graves of such luminaries as Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski and the Vilna Gaon, and a gravestone for the Ba’al Shem Tov.  His wife accompanied him on all the trips but two, when his daughters came instead. He wanted the insurance of American passports belonging to citizens born in America; his passport indicated that he was a naturalized citizen, and he did not want to be ""reclaimed"" by Latvia.  He also wanted to demonstrate that they were tourists, not spies; a spy would not have his family accompany him.
He opposed demonstrations against the Soviet government; people criticized his approach of quietly applying for visas and repeatedly going to Russia. He did not want publicity; he did not speak about what he did on these trips. He was concerned that if the name of a person he worked with would become known, that person might be imprisoned.
After he died, and as Russia changed, emigrants started to tell what he had done. If a person wanted to leave Russia, he could take nothing along except for some clothing; everything of value was confiscated.  Rav Teitz arranged with a family that was planning to exit: they would trade all their possessions for rubles; he would return the money to them in dollars when they got out. He gave the rubles to refuseniks who had been dismissed from their jobs, and to old people who were living in poverty, including a few talmidei hakhamim, Torah scholars, who were destitute. When the family reached the United States, he gave them dollars. They were able to start a business; within a few years, they bought a house.
Two men who were in the USSR appreciated what Rav Teitz was doing:  Rav Eliyahu Essas, who led a return to Jewish education and observance in Russia, and now teaches Torah in Israel.; Rav Yitzchak Zilber (1917-2004), who stood up for his beliefs in Tashkent, encouraged others to do the same, and became the ""rabbi of the Russians"" in Israel when he arrived there in 1972.


=== Daf Hashavua ===
In 1953, in order to awaken Jews who knew Yiddish, but had gotten distant from their origins, he founded a half-hour radio program of Talmud, Daf Hashavua, aired at 9:30 on Saturday night. He chose WEVD, a socialist station, to reach his intended audience. Over the years he taught 9 Tractates - Brakhot, Rosh Hashanah, Yoma, Sukkah and others that would be immediately relevant.  The program continued until 1988.
To meet the demand for texts each time he started a new tractate, he printed copies with line numbers so that listeners could easily find the place. He sent tapes for broadcasts in local stations to Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Miami, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Kol Yisrael LaGolah aired the tapes behind the Iron Curtain. When the U.S. government monitored foreign language programs, it reported 200,000 listeners.  His son, Rabbi Elazar Mayer Teitz, taught Talmud on the radio in English for eleven years.
There were objections from people who thought that Torah on the radio was forbidden. While David Eisenberg wrote in ""She’arim"" May 15, 1955 about ""Limmud Torah Ba’rabim:  Rive’vot Ma’azinim L’ Shiuro Shel HaRav Pinchas Mordechai Teitz,"" others were not positive. But Rabbi Yitzchak Herzog, Rabbi Shmuel Belkin,  Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg and Rabbi Yosef Kahaneman, who spoke at the one-year celebration of the broadcast, all wrote in favor of teaching Torah through modern technology. In a taped message from Jerusalem  to the celebration, Rav Herzog said perhaps this was the reason the radio was invented. Tapes of Rav Teitz's broadcasts demonstrated that here was another new technology that could be used to teach Torah; Torah Tapes were in the future.


== Publications ==
He joined the Machon Tzofnas Paneiah, to publish the works of Rabbi Yosef Rosen, the Rogatchover. When Rabbi Menachem Kasher died in 1983, he became the head of the group.  For one volume, he added an analysis of reasons for this scholar's unusual ways, and an account of his insights. His mind was like a computer, containing the entire Written and Oral Torah; he was extraordinary in drawing connections.
Meeting another great scholar in Dvinsk had two other benefits. When Rav Meir Simhah HaKohen told him that he had written the Meshekh Hokhmah, his commentary on the Bible, years earlier but now needed a young person to help him edit it, Pinchas, who was a student at Slabodka, found a student who worked with the rabbi to prepare the manuscript for publication. Fifty years later, Rav Teitz published a volume of responsa, She’ailot U’Tshuvot Or Samei’akh, and added a memorial list of the k’lei kodesh, those who served the religious needs of Latvian Jewry, giving their names, occupations, and where they had lived before the Holocaust.
Rabbi Teitz also raised the funds to publish Ma'lot ha-Torah that Rabbis Michel Feinstein and Nissan Waxman had edited.


=== Questions and Responsa ===
His correspondence with Rabbi Moshe Feinstein is well-known, particularly regarding 1. the question of bringing a seeing-eye dog into the synagogue, 2. the kashrut of whiskey aged in barrels that had been used to age non-kosher wines 3. does the recipient of a sefer that he did not request have an obligation to pay for it? 4. In retrieving books after the Holocaust, is there an obligation to restore them to their owners?
The question about learning Torah on the radio resulted in a number of articles in halakhic articles from 1953 on. Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg settled the matter with his responsum on ""Limmud HaTorah BaRabbim al Y’dei Ha’Radio.""
He also wrote a number of pamphlets in Hebrew and Yiddish: 

ʻOrah! : a ruf tsu der Ameriḳaner orṭodoḳsi, Brooklyn, 1936.
Mafteaḥ shel geʼulah, Elizabeth, 1948.
Ḳonservaṭizm vuhin?, New York, 1953.
In 1953, together with Rabbi Simcha Elberg, he printed Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg’s פנוי עצמות מתים, about the halakhic permissibility of moving the bones of dead people, an important halakhic concern after WWII. In the same year they published a pamphlet, מכתבי תורה, their correspondence on halakhic questions.


== Communal activity ==


=== Civil rights ===
On Sunday, August 25, 1963, a rally was held at the Polo Grounds to encourage participation in Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington scheduled for Wednesday, August 28. Rabbi Teitz spoke about racial discrimination as a moral sin, as a wall that divides one part of America from the other. He hoped that the march would bring that wall down, just as the wall of Jericho had fallen. He envisioned a time when ""we will emerge from this crisis unified and strengthened as one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."" The New York Times reported after the rally that among the representatives of major faiths, Rabbi Teitz spoke for the Union of Orthodox Rabbis.


=== Other communal activities ===
In June 1935, Rabbi Teitz spoke at a meeting of Agudath HaRabbanim - The Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the U.S. and Canada - about the need for rabbis to speak English if they wanted to communicate with the younger generation. His membership dues were returned to him for daring to criticize the older members. The group soon re-considered and appointed him Chairman of the Vaad Hapo’el. Twenty-one years later, he became a member of the Presidium together with Rabbi Eliezer Silver and Rabbi Dovid Lifshitz.  He was dismayed by the insistence on criticizing other movements instead of creating positive programs and recruiting young members.
In 1981, he and Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky founded Merkaz HaRabbanim, a rabbinic group that would welcome young members and encourage them to serve the community as rabbis, teachers and other positions, rather than staying in a kollel with no time-limit. The major rabbinic/yeshiva leaders in Israel, Rabbi Elazar Menachem Man Shach and Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky sent letters of approval and encouragement to the new group.  The young men ensconced in kollel had to get in touch with the world beyond the yeshiva walls. After three years, the Merkaz HaRabbanim closed; it was ahead of its time.
Two decades earlier, Rabbi Teitz wanted to start a movement for teshuvah, a return to Torah.  He called it Takhlit, the first ‘T’ for tenu’ah, a movement, and the second ‘t’ for teshuvah. It did not catch on in 1963. But he was happy to see other groups in the following decades start beginner's minyanim, teach people to read Hebrew, help people turn their home kosher, and invite returnees for Shabbat meals.
He believed that leadership meant responsibility; it was not a popularity contest. It required creativity, not criticizing others.
Rabbi Teitz died on the 4th of Tevet 5756, December 26, 1995.  His many children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren share his qualities of kindness and friendship, together with joy in life.

94,"Solomon Sharfman was a rabbi of Orthodox Jewry who built the Flatbush Modern Orthodox Jewish community in the mid-1900s.


== Life ==
Solomon Joseph Sharfman was born on November 1, 1915, in Treblinka, Poland; his family came to the United States five years later. His father, Rabbi Label Sharfman, worked as a shochet in Newark, New Jersey. He attended Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim and reportedly made up the name ""The Rabbinical Seminary of America"" when registering the new institution with the City of New York, because the city did not want to accept a Hebrew name.
For over forty years, from 1938 to 1984, Sharfman was the rabbi of Young Israel of Flatbush, the pulpit from which he led American Jewry. For two years, from 1956 to 1958, he served as president of the Rabbinical Council of America, and from 1969 to 1971, he was president of the Synagogue Council of America.
Rabbi Sharfman maintained a relationship with rabbinic luminaries of the era, such as Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and Rabbi Moshe Feinstein.
His writings are included in a number of compilations of rabbinic literature (""Homer LeDerush"") of the National Council of Young Israel. He died in his sleep on December 19, 2004.


== Legacy ==


=== Communal ===
Rabbi Sharfman was an early (1950s) opponent to New York's Sunday Blue laws.
In 1989 he helped focus the attention of the National Council of Young Israel on JustOneLife, an organization that provides professional counseling and financial assistance, enabling and empowering mothers to choose to continue their pregnancies to term. As of 2017 the organization is still in operation.


=== Personal ===
He was survived by his wife and their sons and daughters, along with many grandchildren and greatgrandchildren.
His son, Rabbi Label Sharfman, founded and heads the Bnot Torah Seminary in the Sanhedria Murchevet neighborhood in Jerusalem, Israel, otherwise known as ""Sharfman's"". Notable grandchildren include Rabbi Eliakim Koenigsberg, Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshivat R' Yitzchak Elchanan (RIETS). A sister of Rabbi Koenigsberg is married to Rabbi Meir Orlian, who  is the rabbi and Dayan of a synagogue in Yad Binyamin and teaches in Yeshivat Shaalvim and Kerem BeYavneh. Another sister, Dr. Chani (née Koenigsberg) Maybruch EdD, MA, is a relationship educator and coach along with her husband Rabbi Shmuel Maybruch. His youngest grandson is R' David Diament, honorary lecturer at The 2018 Dr. Abraham S. and Phyllis Weissman Memorial Rabbinic Lecture in RIETS.

== Biography ==


=== Family and education ===
Michael Lerner was born February 11, 1943 and grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. In his youth, he attended Far Brook Country Day School, a private school that he characterized as having ""a rich commitment to interdenominational Christianity"". While he has written that he appreciated ""the immense beauty and wisdom of the Christianity to which [he] was being exposed"", he also felt religiously isolated, as the child of passionate Zionists who attended Hebrew school three times a week, while at the same time being heavily exposed to Christian-oriented cultural activities in school. At his own request, in the 7th grade he switched to a public school in the Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, where his peers were, in his estimation, 80% Jewish. He graduated from Weequahic High School in 1960. Lerner received a BA degree from Columbia University. In 1972 he earned a PhD in philosophy from University of California, Berkeley. In 1977 he received a PhD in Clinical/Social Psychology from the Wright Institute in Berkeley. Lerner was married to Nan Fink until 1991, and married Debora Kohn in July 1998, divorced in 2014, and then remarried to Cat Zavis in 2015, divorce proceedings were initiated in 2024. Lerner has one son and two grandchildren.


=== Student activism ===
While at Berkeley, Lerner became a leader in the Berkeley student movement and the Free Speech Movement, chair of the Free Student Union, and chair from 1966 to 1968 of the Berkeley chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). After teaching philosophy of law at San Francisco State University, he took a job as an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Washington and taught ethics, social and political philosophy, philosophy of literature and culture, and introduction to philosophy.
Distressed over the disintegration of SDS in 1969, Lerner sought to re-organize New Left cadres formerly associated with SDS in a new organization called the Seattle Liberation Front (SLF) on January 19, 1970. While SLF did not publicly endorse violence as a political tactic, SLF members including Roger Lippman, Michael Justesen, and Susan Stern were also members of the Weather Underground, which had bombing attacks as a central part of its political strategy. After the ""Day After"" demonstration SLF had called on February 17, 1970 (to protest the verdicts in the Chicago Seven trial) turned violent, Lerner and others were arrested and charged with inciting a riot.
Lerner and his co-defendants became known as the ""Seattle Seven"". During their trial, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover issued a public statement (repeated on radio and television) that described Lerner as ""one of the most dangerous criminals in America"", even though he had never engaged in any act of violence. Federal agents testifying at the trial later admitted to having played a major role instigating the violence and ensuing riot.
The trial culminated in a courtroom brawl (during which Lerner was the only defendant to remain seated), and the presiding judge sent the defendants to jail on contempt of court charges. Lerner was transported to Terminal Island Federal Penitentiary in San Pedro, California, where he served several months before the 9th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals overturned his conviction for contempt of court and ordered him released. The main charges relating to the riot were subsequently dropped by the federal government.
Meanwhile, the Washington State Legislature had passed a law, commonly referred to as the ""Lerner Act"", that prohibited the University of Washington from hiring anyone ""who might engage in illegal political activity"", and Lerner's contract was not renewed. (The law was later overturned by the Washington Supreme Court).
During this period Lerner met several times with boxer Muhammad Ali, who was also active in the anti-war movement, at anti-war meetings organized by Lerner. Lerner recounts that Ali was the first practicing Muslim he had ever met. The two never met or spoke again after this period though in 1995 Lerner received a letter from Ali expressing appreciation for the book Lerner co-authored with Cornel West, Jews and Blacks: Let the Healing Begin. Muhammad Ali included an invitation to Lerner to speak at Ali's memorial, to represent progressive Jewish faith, which took place in 2016. Lerner also learned from Ali's lawyer that Ali had been a ""big fan"" of the rabbi's work and that Ali was really sorry that he had not made more contact with Lerner over the past two decades. Ali and his wife had intended to do so many times and just hadn't followed through.


=== Professorship and research ===
After completing his Ph.D. Lerner moved to Hartford, Connecticut where he served as professor of philosophy at Trinity College until 1975, when he moved back to Berkeley, joined the faculty at the University of California in the Field Studies program and taught law and economics until 1976 when he accepted a position at Sonoma State University for one year in sociology, teaching courses in social psychology. Meanwhile, he completed a second Ph.D. in 1977, this one in social/clinical psychology at the Wright Institute in Berkeley.
In 1976 Lerner founded the Institute for Labor and Mental Health to work with the labor movement and do research on the psychodynamics of American society. In 1979 he received a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to train union shop stewards as agents of prevention for mental health disorders, and he simultaneously extended his previous study of the psychodynamics of American society. With a subsequent grant from the NIMH he studied American politics and reported that ""a spiritual crisis"" was at the heart of the political transformation of American society as well as at the heart of much of the psychic pain that was being treated in individual therapy.
His writing reflects a transposition of this analysis to economics too, viz. ""This focus on money and power may do wonders in the marketplace, but it creates a tremendous crisis in our society. People who have spent all day learning how to sell themselves and to manipulate others are in no position to form lasting friendships or intimate relationships... Many Americans hunger for a different kind of society—one based on principles of caring, ethical and spiritual sensitivity, and communal solidarity. Their need for meaning is just as intense as their need for economic security."" :


=== Tikkun magazine ===
After serving for five years as dean of the graduate school of psychology at New College of California (now defunct) in San Francisco, Lerner and his then-wife Nan Fink created a general-interest intellectual magazine called Tikkun: A Bimonthly Jewish Critique of Politics, Culture and Society. Tikkun was started with the intention of challenging the Left for its inability to understand the centrality of religious and spiritual concerns in the lives of ordinary Americans.
With his associate editor Peter Gabel, Lerner developed a ""politics of meaning"": that Americans hunger not only for material security but also for a life that is connected to some higher meaning, and that the failure of the liberal and progressive movements to win a consistent majority support was based on their inability to understand this hunger and to address it by showing Americans and middle income working people in other advanced industrial societies that it was the values of the competitive marketplace and its Bottom Line of money and power that is the fundamental source undermining ethical and spiritual values in the public sphere and then undermining friendships and marriages when these values are brought home into personal life.
This was intended to speak to the hunger for meaning that was characteristic of the thousands of people that Lerner and his colleagues were studying at the Institute for Labor and Mental Health. Tikkun was formed to educate the public about the findings of the Institute and to develop some of the implications of that work. However, because it also had an interest in being an ""alternative to the voices of Jewish conservatism,"" Tikkun was criticized by some Jewish groups.
In 1993, First Lady Hillary Clinton included the ""politics of meaning"" in her synthesis of political and social philosophy she was forming.
In 2002, Lerner organized a group called the Tikkun Community among readers of Tikkun magazine and those who share its editorial vision.


=== Rabbinical ordination ===
Lerner received rabbinical ordination in 1995 through a beth din (rabbinical court) composed of three rabbis, ""each of whom had received orthodox rabbinic ordination"". According to j. the Jewish news weekly, ""mainstream rabbinical leaders of the Reform, Conservative and Orthodox movements"" have questioned private ordinations such as Lerner's, arguing that non-seminary ordinations risk producing poorly educated or fraudulent Rabbis. Similarly, some rabbis have challenged Lerner's decision to not be trained for the rabbinate in a classical Jewish seminary (although Lerner did spend three years as a student at Jewish Theological Seminary). Lerner has been quoted in Jewish Weekly as saying that the non-seminary track is one that ""every Chabad rabbi takes, & every ultra-Orthodox rabbi"". Lerner pointed out that none of the rabbis in Jewish history ever attended a ""seminary"" until the middle of the 19th century, and that most rabbis in Israel today did not attend a seminary. They were ordained in the same manner, a Beth din composed of three rabbis. When Lerner attacked seminaries for being ""more interested in producing organizational men for Jewish life than spiritual leaders connected to the deepest spiritual and social-justice minds"", Rabbi Alan Lew said ""That is arrogant nonsense ... I spent six years in extremely rigorous, round-the-clock study in the classic texts of our tradition. Authentic Jewish spirituality is in the texts, not in some fancy New Age ideas or watered-down kabbalah"". Lerner's synagogue 'Beyt Tikkun' became an embodiment of what he described as ""neo-Hasidism,"" passionately pursuing the spiritual dimension of the prayers rather than rushing through them. The goal, he insisted, is to connect to God, not simply mouth every prayer in the prayerbook. His synagogue grew, according to members, not only because of Lerner's willingness to take the social justice message of the prophets seriously, but also because the actual experience of being involved in prayer, meditation, singing and dancing in the synagogue became an ecstatic experience of transcendence for many of those who attended. Lerner's 1994 book Jewish Renewal: A Path to Healing and Transformation published by HarperCollins (and in paperback as a Harper Perennial), became a national best-seller and brought thousands of young people into the emerging Jewish Renewal movement. After studying his background and qualifications, the Northern California Board of Rabbis accepted Lerner as a full member and he has remained a member ever since. Lerner was the first Jewish Renewal rabbi to achieve membership in a local American Board of Rabbis, but since that time in 1997, many local Boards of Rabbis have accepted Jewish Renewal rabbis into full membership.
Lerner is the spiritual leader of Beyt Tikkun synagogue in Berkeley, and a member of the Board of Rabbis of Northern California. He is also a member of Ohalah, the organization of Jewish Renewal Rabbis.


=== Network of Spiritual Progressives ===
In 2005 Lerner became chair of The Network of Spiritual Progressives whose mission was to ""challenge the materialism and selfishness in American society and to promote an ethos of love, generosity, and awe and wonder at the grandeur of the universe."" They have since sponsored national conferences on both the East and West Coast. In 2007 Lerner launched a campaign for a ""Global Marshall Plan"".


=== Cancer ===
In February 2009 Lerner publicly announced he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and mentioned this in many promotional mailings and published pieces. He was treated with surgery in March 2009, which was apparently successful.


== Lerner's views ==


=== Positive Judaism ===
Lerner, a rabbi in ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal, promotes the concept of Jewish Renewal, a small Jewish movement that he describes as ""positive Judaism"", rejecting what he considers to be ethnocentric interpretations of the Torah. His publications promote religious pluralism and progressive or liberal approaches to political problems. He has, for example, been outspoken against attacks on immigrant communities in the United States, and has attempted to build bridges with Christian, Buddhist and Muslim leaders around such issues.
Lerner's call for a spiritual transformation of American society was first articulated in Tikkun and then in his book The Politics of Meaning. Lerner developed these ideas further in his books Spirit Matters (2000) and The Left Hand of God (2006).
Lerner strongly objected to Israel's occupation of the West Bank. He supports the adoption of the Geneva Accords as a basis for an independent Palestinian state.
In February 2007, Lerner published a column entitled ""There Is No New Anti-Semitism,"" in which he criticized some American Jewish organizations for labeling critics of Israel as antisemites. He was especially critical of the Anti-Defamation League and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which he characterized as ""Israel-can-do-no-wrong voices in American politics."" Lerner wrote that this mentality, which frequently leads to accusations that Jews who oppose Israel's policies toward the Palestinians are ""self-hating Jews,"" is alienating young Jews who ""say that they can no longer identify with their Jewishness.""


=== Controversy ===
Lerner describes some of his views as ""very controversial,"" particularly his views about building peace between Israel and Palestine. In 2003, the San Diego Jewish Journal described Lerner as ""the most controversial Jew in America,"" writing that ""He is relentlessly critical of Israel. He eulogizes Rachel Corrie. And he's done more for peace than any conservative we know."" That same year, the executive editor of The Jewish Exponent wrote that Lerner ""supports every measure against Israel short of its immediate destruction and often makes common cause with those who do plot the eradication of Israel's Jews.""
In 1997, former Tikkun editors accused Lerner of publishing pseudonymous letters to the editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory (""Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many of us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say.""), a few were critical (""Have you gone off your rocker?""). Lerner admitted that he had fabricated the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.


=== Criticism of leftist antisemitism ===
For many years, Lerner has been an outspoken critic of modern antisemitism that he perceives to have arisen among some leftists. In 1992, he wrote The Socialism of Fools: Anti-Semitism on the Left, in which he described the manner in which the left often denies the existence of antisemitism; defended Zionism and distinguished legitimate criticism of the State of Israel from Israel-bashing and antisemitism; and suggested ways in which progressives can fight antisemitism on the Left.
In 2003, Lerner criticized the left-wing anti-war ANSWER Coalition for the antisemitism that he and others believe is reflected in the rhetoric at ANSWER-sponsored demonstrations. He later claimed that because of his criticism the ANSWER coalition — of which Lerner's Tikkun Community was a member — barred him from speaking at their rallies against the 2003 invasion of Iraq.


=== Good Friday Prayer for the Jews ===
Regarding the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, which allows the re-introduction of the Tridentine Mass and the related Good Friday Prayer for the Jews, he said that the Pope took ""a powerful step toward the re-introduction of the process of demeaning Jews. You cannot respect another religion if you teach that those who are part of it must convert to your own religion.""


== Beyt Tikkun Synagogue ==
Beyt Tikkun Synagogue is a Jewish Renewal congregation in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. It is a loosely organized unconventional endeavor with a small physical base, that is also described by its founder as a ""synagogue-without-walls"" that since its founding has served as a bully pulpit for its equally unconventional founding-rabbi since its inception.


=== History ===
Beyt Tikkun was founded in 1996 by Rabbi Michael Lerner, and is loosely affiliated with Lerner's Tikkun magazine. It describes itself as a ""hallachic community bound by Jewish law"".
Beyt Tikkun has no building of its own, and the San Francisco Chronicle as well as The New York Times called it the ""synagogue-without-walls in San Francisco and Berkeley"".
In 2010 Lerner, recovering from cancer, moved the Beyt Tikkun Synagogue closer to his Berkeley home to the East Bay, near the UC Berkeley campus.


=== Controversies ===
Beyt Tikkun found itself in the middle of controversies in 2005 and 2007 when it invited anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan to speak during Yom Kippur services.
Code Pink activist Rae Abliea addressed the synagogue, against the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip, on September 29, 2011.


== Awards and honors ==
While at the Seminary, Lerner was elected national president of Atid, the college organization of the United Synagogue of America. Lerner was chosen by Utne Reader in 1995 as one of the world's ""100 top visionaries"" along with Vaclav Havel and Noam Chomsky. In 2005 Lerner received the Gandhi, King, Ikeda Community Builders Prize from Morehouse College in Atlanta in recognition of his work in forging a ""progressive middle path that is both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine"" in his book Healing Israel/Palestine and in his writing in Tikkun magazine. Tikkun magazine, which Lerner continues to edit, received from the mainstream media organization RNA The Religion Newswriters Association, the ""Best Magazine of the Year"" Award in both 2014 and 2015.


== Television appearances ==
Lerner has been a guest on Larry King Live several times. On March 5, 2006, he discussed his book The Left Hand of God on C-SPAN. Lerner was part of a panel of religious leaders on Meet the Press with Tim Russert on April 16, 2006. He was interviewed on Jewish reactions to the Christian Zionist movement of Rev. Hagee on the Bill Moyers PBS show on October 7, 2007.
Lerner delivered a eulogy at the memorial service for Muhammad Ali on June 10, 2016, praising Ali's stances on social justice and calling for an end to antisemitism, homophobia, and Islamophobia. Lerner said ""the way to honor the memory of Muhammad Ali is to be Muhammad Ali today in our own lives."" ""Tell the leaders of Turkey to stop bombing and murdering their Kurd minority. Tell the U.S. to stop sending military supplies to Saudi Arabia, which is the sponsor of some of the most hate-filled teachings in the Islamic world and is one of the most repressive regimes on the face of the earth.""


== Goldstone report and vandalism of Lerner's home ==
Lerner is one of a small group of Jewish leaders who supported Judge Richard Goldstone after Goldstone released his United Nations report that accused Israel and Hamas of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the winter 2009 Gaza War. After Tikkun magazine announced that it would award Goldstone with its Tikkun Award, Lerner's home was vandalized several times, with posters caricaturing him as a Nazi.

96,"Nehorai Garmon (Hebrew: נהוראי ג׳רמון; c. 1682–1760) was a rabbi and poet from Ottoman Tripolitania.
Born in Tripoli, Garmon went to Tunis at the age of twenty, and studied Talmud under Isaac Lumbroso, whom he succeeded in the rabbinate. He was the author of Yeter ha-Baz, published posthumously in Livorno in 1787, consisting of novellæ on the Talmud and on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. Printed with the work are eleven poems of the author, and the novellæ of his son Ḥayyim (d. 1781). Garmon lost a large part of his writings in an attack on the Jewish quarter.

97,"Nelson Glueck (June 4, 1900 – February 12, 1971) was an American rabbi, academic and archaeologist.  He served as president of Hebrew Union College from 1947 until his death, and his pioneering work in biblical archaeology resulted in the discovery of 1,500 ancient sites.


== Biography ==
Nelson Glueck was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to Lithuanian Jewish parents.
He died in Cincinnati in 1971, after announcing plans to step down from the HUC presidency and four months after his final trip to Israel. He was succeeded as president of HUC by Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk.


== Rabbinic career ==

Glueck developed a passion for religion early in life, and was ordained as a Reform rabbi in 1923. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Jena in Germany in 1926. By 1928 he was a member of the Hebrew Union College faculty, teaching at the seminary of the Reform Jewish movement.


== Archaeology career ==
In the course of his career, he became an expert on ancient pottery, he was able to match small ceramic fragments to distinct time periods. He was the first to identify some ancient wares such as Edomite and Midianite pottery, re-discovered what is now called Negevite pottery, and surveyed many unknown sites in the Transjordan.
During World War II, Glueck used his intimate knowledge of Palestine's geography to help the Office of Strategic Services develop a contingency plan for a retreat from German field marshal Rommel's advance through Northern Africa. Rommel was stopped, however, and the plan was not needed.
In the 1950s, Glueck discovered remains of the advanced Nabataean civilization in Jordan. Using irrigation, the Nabataeans were able to grow crops and develop a densely populated civilization in the Negev desert, despite receiving under 6 inches (15 cm) of rainfall a year. Glueck worked with Israeli leaders to build an irrigation system modeled on that of the Nabataeans.
Glueck's scholarship led to personal relationships with many world leaders: he delivered the benediction at President John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961; and he was personal friends with many of the State of Israel's early leaders, including David Ben-Gurion, Abba Eban, Golda Meir, Henrietta Szold and Judah Magnes.
He was the author of several books on archaeology, religion, and the intersection of the two.  They include Explorations in Eastern Palestine (4 vol., 1934–51), The Other Side of the Jordan (1940), The River Jordan (1946), Rivers in the Desert: A History of the Negev (1959), Deities and Dolphins (1965), and Hesed in the Bible (1968)...Even though he worked to develop a historical understanding of biblical events and argued that the archaeological finds do affirm the biblical descriptions, he always maintained that his faith was not based on a literal interpretation of the Bible. To do that, he once said, would be to ""confuse fact with faith, history with holiness, science with religion.""


== Awards and commemoration ==
Glueck was an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society (1954) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1966). The Nelson Glueck School of Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew Union College is named after him.

98,"Carole Meyers was the first female rabbi in Southern California to lead a congregation full-time. She first became interested in becoming a rabbi after her father died when she was 13 and her stepfather died when she was 19, and the rituals and community support of the synagogue helped her through her grief. Meyers was ordained in 1983 by the Reform Jewish seminary Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, and spent three years as assistant rabbi of Congregation Beth Israel in Houston. She became the rabbi of Temple Sinai of Glendale in 1986, when she was 29. She resigned in 2001, and died in 2007 of bone cancer. She was married to Ralph Zarefsky and had two sons. After her death, in 2018, a book of her sermons was published, titled Leaning on God: Sermons by Rabbi Carole L. Meyers.

He received a Tony Award for Best Musical as a producer for the musical A Strange Loop (2019). 


== Early life ==

RuPaul was born in San Diego on November 17, 1960, the son of Ernestine ""Toni"" (née Fontenette) and Irving Andrew Charles. His parents were both from Louisiana. He was named by his mother; ""Ru"" came from roux, the French term for the base of gumbo and other creole stews and soups. According to DNA analysis by Finding Your Roots staff, his ancestry is 70% African and 30% European.
After his parents divorced in 1967, RuPaul and his three sisters lived with their mother, a Seventh-day Adventist. He was raised in the Catholic faith and attended Patrick Henry High School.
At 15, RuPaul and his sister Renetta moved to Atlanta, where they studied performing arts. RuPaul struggled as a musician and filmmaker during the 1980s, working at Atlanta's Plaza Theatre. In 1982, he debuted on an Atlanta public access variety show called The American Music Show, and went on to appear on the show frequently.: 59  He also took part in underground cinema, helping create the low-budget film Star Booty and an album of the same name. In Atlanta he often performed at the Celebrity Club, managed by Larry Tee, as a bar dancer or with his band, Wee Wee Pole. RuPaul also performed as a backup singer to Glen Meadmore along with drag queen Vaginal Davis. His first prominent national exposure came in 1989, when he danced as an extra in the video for The B-52s' ""Love Shack"".
In the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. Initially participating in gender bender-style performances, he performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at several New York City nightclubs, most notably the Pyramid Club. He played opposite New York City drag performer Mona Foot (Nashom Benjamin) in the one-act science-fiction parody ""My Pet Homo"", written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. He performed for many years at the annual Wigstock drag festival and appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie.
In the 1990s, RuPaul was known in the UK for his appearances on the Channel 4 series Manhattan Cable, a weekly series produced by World of Wonder and presented by American Laurie Pike about New York's public-access television system.
He also worked at WKTU in the late 1990s and was hired at WNEW in 2004.


== Career ==


=== 1993–1997: Supermodel of the World, Foxy Lady, and Ho Ho Ho ===
In 1993, RuPaul recorded the dance/house album Supermodel of the World. It was released through the rap label Tommy Boy, spawning the dance track hit ""Supermodel (You Better Work)"". The song peaked at 45 on the Billboard Hot 100. It charted on the UK Singles Chart, peaking on the top 40 at 39. The song found the most success on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where it peaked at 2. Radio airplay, heavy rotation of the music video on MTV, and television appearances on popular programs like The Arsenio Hall Show popularized the song.

What other people think of me is not my business. What I do is what I do. How people see me doesn't change what I decide to do. I don't choose projects so people don't see me as one thing or another. I choose projects that excite me. I think the problem is that people refuse to understand what drag is outside of their own belief system.
His next two singles/videos, ""Back to My Roots"" and ""A Shade Shady (Now Prance)"", both went to the top spot on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and furthered his campy persona. His following release ""House of Love"" failed to place on any U.S. charts but peaked at 68 on the UK Singles Chart.
RuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for MAC Cosmetics. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text ""I am the MAC girl"". He also released his autobiography, Lettin' It All Hang Out. He promoted the book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on ABC's All My Children, in a storyline that put it on the set of Erica Kane's talk show ""The Cutting Edge"". The same year, he was featured in his first of two appearances in the Brady Bunch movies, in which he played Jan's female guidance counselor.
The next year he landed a talk show of his own on VH1, called The RuPaul Show interviewing celebrity guests and musical acts. Cher, Diana Ross, Nirvana, Duran Duran, Pat Benatar, Mary J. Blige, Bea Arthur, Dionne Warwick, Cyndi Lauper, Olivia Newton-John, Beenie Man, Pete Burns, Bow Wow Wow, and the Backstreet Boys were notable guests. His co-host was Michelle Visage with whom he also co-hosted on WKTU radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests Chi Chi LaRue and Tom Chase speaking about the gay porn industry.
Later in the year he released his second album, Foxy Lady, this time on the L.A.-based Rhino Records label. The album failed to chart on the Billboard 200. However, its first single ""Snapshot"" went to number four on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, which was his second and final solo Hot 100 entry to date. The album's second single ""A Little Bit of Love"" was not as successful, peaking at 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. During this time, RuPaul helped launch the return of WKTU radio in New York City and would serve as host of its morning show until 1998.
In 1997, he released his third album, the Christmas-themed Ho Ho Ho. That year, RuPaul teamed with Martha Wash to remake the classic disco anthem, ""It's Raining Men"". The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD RuPaul's Go Go Box Classics. During this time, he appeared in Webex TV commercials and magazine ads. In 2002, he was featured on the Eurodance track ""You're No Lady"" alongside Brigitte Nielsen.


=== 2004–2007: Red Hot, ReWorked, and Starrbooty ===

In 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, Red Hot on his own RuCo Inc. music label. It received dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his blog he discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, particularly the gay press. In one incident, it was noted that Entertainment Weekly refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to ""a black person being invited to a party, but only if they'll serve."" Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, Red Hot's lead single ""Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous"" peaked at number two on the dance chart. The second, ""WorkOut"", peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album ""People Are People"" a duet with Tom Trujillo, peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the Top Electronic Albums chart, where it hit number nine. RuPaul later noted, ""Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. 'Betrayed' alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don't feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don't know what happened. It seemed I couldn't get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals.""
On June 13, 2006, RuPaul released ReWorked, his first remix album and fifth album overall. It features reworked versions of songs from his back catalog, as well as new recordings. The only single released from the album was a re-recording of ""Supermodel (You Better Work)"", which reached number 21 on the U.S. dance chart. June 20, 2007, saw the release of Starrbooty: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack in the United States. The single ""Call Me Starrbooty"" was digitally released in 2007. The album contains new tracks as well as interludes with dialogue from the movie. The film was released on DVD in October 2007.


=== 2008–2010: RuPaul's Drag Race and Champion ===

In mid-2008, RuPaul began producing RuPaul's Drag Race, a reality television game show which aired on Logo in February 2009. On the program drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as ""America's next drag superstar"". The first season's winner was BeBe Zahara Benet, and first runner-up Nina Flowers was chosen by fans as ""Miss Congeniality"" through voting via the show's official website. To publicize the new show, RuPaul appeared on several other shows in 2008, including Project Runway, as guest judge, and on Paula's Party as a guest ""chef"".
In March 2009, RuPaul released the album Champion. The album spawned four singles ""Cover Girl"", ""Jealous of My Boogie"", ""Devil Made Me Do It"", and ""Tranny Chaser"". The album peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums as well as 26 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Logo's second annual NewNowNext Awards in 2009 were hosted by RuPaul. There he performed ""Jealous of My Boogie (Gomi & RasJek Edit)"". In March 2010, RuPaul released his second remix album, Drag Race, the album features remixes of songs from the 2009 album Champion.

On April 30, 2013, he released a single ""Lick It Lollipop"" featuring Lady Bunny, who RuPaul previously collaborated with on Champion. On October 25, 2013, he reported via Twitter that the new album would be released in January 2014.
In fall of 2013, RuPaul joined forces with cosmetic manufacturers Colorevolution to launch his debut make-up line featuring ultra-rich pigment cosmetics and a beauty collection. Released alongside the line was a unisex perfume entitled ""Glamazon"". Talking to World of Wonder he said: ""Glamazon is for women and men of all ages and preferences who share one thing in common: They are not afraid to be fierce. For me, glamour should be accessible to all, and I am committed to helping the world look and smell more beautiful."" The line was exclusively sold on the Colorevolution website in various gift sets.

=== 2017–2018: Remember Me, American, return to VH1, and Essential, Vol. 2 ===
On January 27, 2017, RuPaul announced that a new album would be released the week after. The album, named Remember Me: Essential, Vol. 1 was put up for pre-order on February 2 and eventually released the next day. It is a collection of new songs and remakes of classic RuPaul hits that feature new artists. Two singles have been released from the album so far: ""Rock It (To The Moon)"" which is a new song loosely based on the lyrics and the melody of ""Hey Booty"" which was released on the Starrbooty soundtrack in 2007, and an updated version of RuPaul's 1996 hit single ""Snapshot"" from the album Foxy Lady. The album failed to chart on the Dance Albums Chart but managed to debut at number four on the Billboard Dance Albums Sales Chart in the United States. It also charted at number eleven on the UK Dance Albums Chart, becoming RuPaul's highest-charting album on that chart, after Realness managed to debut and peak at number 13.
On March 24, 2017, RuPaul released his eleventh studio album, American. Later on the same day, the ninth regular season of RuPaul's Drag Race debuted on basic cable channel VH1, home of RuPaul's talk show in the 1990s. It moved from the expanded cable channel Logo TV which aired all previous seasons of the show. The season 9 premiere featured singer Lady Gaga as its guest judge and was a success, with ratings of nearly 1,000,000 viewers making it the series' most viewed episode. The number was double LogoTV's season 8 premiere ratings from the year prior, and triple VH1's usual Friday night viewership in that programming timeslot. World of Wonder Productions announced they were casting contestants for a tenth season when the ratings were released.
On June 2, 2017, Essential, Vol. 2 was put up on pre-order on iTunes. It was released on June 9 and preceded by the single ""Crying on the Dance Floor"" which is a re-recording of the 2010 single ""Main Event"" from the album Champion. On June 22, 2017, it was announced that RuPaul would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry. He was awarded the honor on March 16, 2018, making him the first drag queen to be given the award.
In August 2018, it was announced that RuPaul will be releasing his third Christmas album in October 2018.


=== 2019–present: Drag Race UK, AJ and the Queen and further TV shows ===

In June 2019, a daytime talk show titled RuPaul premiered. It was cancelled after a three-week test run, since it was not picked by any Fox TV stations. He also appeared in Taylor Swift's ""You Need to Calm Down"" music video.
In late 2019, the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race UK was released on BBC3. It was well-received, with The Guardian stating that the British version had ""saved"" the franchise. It was renewed for a second season which was released in 2021. RuPaul also created and starred in the Netflix drama-comedy show AJ and the Queen as a drag queen touring the country with an unlikely young sidekick, which was released on January 10, 2020. On March 6, 2020, Netflix announced that the series had been cancelled.
Also in January 2020, it was announced that RuPaul would host Saturday Night Live on February 8, 2020, with Justin Bieber as a musical guest. On May 4, 2020, it was announced that RuPaul would be on The Price Is Right at Night airing May 11. He also made an appearance in the premiere episode of Canada's Drag Race.

== Other ventures ==


=== Podcasting ===
The podcast RuPaul: What's the Tee? With Michelle Visage debuted on April 6, 2014. Ru-Paul co-hosts with longtime friend and fellow RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage. The weekly show features their thoughts on topics including behind-the-scenes of RuPaul's Drag Race, life advice, beauty tips, and conversations with featured guests from the entertainment world.


=== Audiobooks ===
In 2018, RuPaul was one of the actors who voiced the audiobook A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo.


=== Drag conventions ===
Launched through production company World of Wonder, RuPaul's DragCon LA is an annual drag-themed convention held in Los Angeles which started in 2015, followed by RuPaul's DragCon NYC. It began in 2007 in New York City; the public is able to meet with RuPaul, former RuPaul's Drag Race contestants, and other drag queens. The conventions feature performances, meet-and-greet booths, merchandise sales and panel discussions.


=== Activism ===
RuPaul has been an active supporter of voter registration, producing a public service announcement supporting National Voter Registration Day and urging everyone to register. As RuPaul said voter ID laws vary from state to state; the details of the voter ID required in each state are provided by HeadCount and VoteRiders. As one in five LGBTQ adults are not registered to vote, voter registration efforts have expanded recently. Several stars from RuPaul's Drag Race act as Ambassadors for Drag Out the Vote.

In March 2023, in response to the Tennessee Adult Entertainment Act, RuPaul, World of Wonder producers Randy Barbarto and Fenton Bailey, and MTV began a fund to fight anti-drag initiatives. The ACLU maintains the fund, which received donations from efforts at DragCon LA 2023, the ""Drag Isn't Dangerous"" livestream telethon, ""Can't Hold us Down"", ""Born This Way"", and ""God Save the Queens"", as well as a small donation from the Manhattan Association of Cabarets.
The Instagram post RuPaul made prior to the establishment of the fund called on followers to vote, saying, ""Register to vote so we can get those stunt queens out of office."" The video ends with the statement, ""By the way, a social media post has never been as powerful as a registered vote.""


== Impact ==
Lauren Herold of Mic.com deemed RuPaul ""arguably the most commercially successful drag queen in America."" Sami Main of Adweek credited him with creating wider exposure for drag queens from LGBT culture into mainstream society, thanks to his early-career chart success, and later, the successive climb in viewership of RuPaul's Drag Race. His talk show The RuPaul Show was the first-ever national talk show to have a drag queen as a host. Along with his partner Michelle Visage, he welcomed an array of high-profile guests such as Cher, Lil Kim, and Diana Ross over the show's 100-episode span. As well as having a variety of comedy skits, the show was noted for discussing topics such as black empowerment, female empowerment, misogyny, and liberal politics that were otherwise unheard of in 1990s television at the time. In 1999, RuPaul was awarded the Vito Russo Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for work in promoting equality in the LGBT community.
RuPaul has also been noted as having a large part in RuPaul's Drag Race's continuous television success. By pioneering queer representation on television, many believe RuPaul to have essentially revolutionised the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community on screen. He first won an Emmy for his work on the show in 2016, and one year later the show garnered eight nominations, including Outstanding Reality-Competition Program for the first time in its 11-season run, and a second consecutive win for RuPaul in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. In 2017, he was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. In 2019, Fortune noted RuPaul as ""easily the world's most famous"" drag queen.


=== Relationship with transgender community ===
RuPaul has been the subject of multiple controversies regarding his comments and actions towards the transgender community. According to Vox, he has a complicated relationship with this community, in part due to differing philosophies: through drag he seeks to mock gender and identity stereotypes, while in his view the trans community takes identity seriously. Nevertheless, RuPaul's Drag Race has featured a number of contestants who are trans women, some of whom made their identity public while competing on the show, including Sonique, Carmen Carrera, Jiggly Caliente, Monica Beverly Hillz, Kenya Michaels, and Gia Gunn. Later seasons of the show have included contestants who had already disclosed their trans identity prior to their season beginning. In 2017, Peppermint became the first contestant to compete throughout her season as an openly trans woman and in 2021 Gottmik was the first to compete as an openly trans man. Other non-conforming gender identities expressed by former contestants include both non-binary (Jinkx Monsoon, Aja, Valentina, Divina de Campo, Ginny Lemon, Violet Chachki, and Sasha Velour) and genderfluid (Courtney Act and Kelly Mantle) persons.
In 2014, trans activists and former contestants Carmen Carrera and Monica Beverly Hillz criticized the show's use of words such as tranny and shemale, including the main challenge announcement phrase up to season 6, ""You've got she-mail"", which they described as transphobic. That year's season also included a ""Female or She-male"" segment that required contestants to guess whether various photographs featured cisgender ""biological women"" or ""psychological women"" (drag queens), causing further criticism. RuPaul and the producers issued a statement promising ""to help spread love, acceptance and understanding"" and Logo TV removed the ""You've got she-mail"" phrase from subsequent broadcasts, replacing it instead with the phrase ""She done already done had herses."" RuPaul criticized those attempting to police his language in bad faith and noted that tranny referred to transvestites and drag queens, not just trans women.
In 2018, RuPaul gave an interview to The Guardian in which he stated that a post-transition trans woman would ""probably not"" be accepted onto the show, noting that at the time of competition Peppermint had not yet had breast implants. After facing criticism on social media and from former contestants for his remarks, RuPaul compared trans drag queens who had transitioned to athletes who had taken performance-enhancing drugs. He subsequently expressed regret for the hurt caused by his remarks, and that the only screening criteria for contestants were ""charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent."" Since he made these statements, multiple transgender contestants have competed on the show.


== Personal life ==
RuPaul met painter Georges LeBar in 1994 at the Limelight nightclub in New York City. They married in January 2017. They have an open marriage; RuPaul has said he would not want to ""put restraints"" on the person he loves. The two split their time between a home in Los Angeles and a 60,000-acre (24,000 ha) ranch in Wyoming. Environmentalists criticized them in 2020 after RuPaul revealed that they lease mineral rights and sell water to oil companies on their ranch, and allow fracking there. According to public maps, the ranch has at least 35 active wells. RuPaul previously held a climate-themed ball on his show to raise environmental awareness, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.
RuPaul publicly endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He expressed dismay at Clinton's defeat by Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying, ""The America that we have all fought so hard for, the narrative of love and peace and liberty and equality, it feels like it is dead."" He has described doing drag as a ""very, very political"" act because it ""challenges the status quo"" by rejecting fixed identities: ""Drag says 'I'm a shapeshifter, I do whatever the hell I want at any given time'.""
RuPaul started smoking cannabis at age 10 or 11. Since 1999, he has been sober and has not had alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. In 2020, he found out while appearing on the TV show Finding Your Roots that he and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker are cousins. In a 2013 interview, RuPaul said, ""I'm not religious, but I do have spiritual practices like yoga and meditation and I do pray.""

103,"Alexander ""Sasha"" Hedges Steinberg (born June 25, 1987), known professionally as Sasha Velour, is an American drag queen, artist, actor, and stage and television producer, based in Brooklyn, New York. Velour is known for winning the ninth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, her drag revue NightGowns, and her one-queen theatrical work, Smoke & Mirrors.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Berkeley, California, Velour was raised in New Haven, Connecticut until the age of nine when her family moved to Urbana, Illinois. Velour is the only child of Mark Steinberg, a scholar of Russian history and professor in the Department of History at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and Jane Hedges, who served as editor at Yale University Press and managing editor of the Slavic Review. Velour is of Russian Jewish descent on her father's side, and identifies with her father's faith. Her grandmother emigrated from the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic via Manchuria.
Velour graduated from University Laboratory High School in Champaign-Urbana in 2004. After high school, she spent a year abroad with family and worked as a part-time security guard at the Russian State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, and interned at the Staatsoper (State Opera) in Berlin, Germany.
Velour obtained a BA from the Independent Program (with a focus on Modern Literatures) from Vassar College in 2009. In 2010, she was a Fulbright Scholar in Moscow and completed a project that aimed to understand the role of different art forms in contemporary Russian society. She received an MFA in cartooning in 2013 from the Center for Cartoon Studies in White River Junction, Vermont. Prior to pursuing drag as a full-time career, Velour worked as a freelance graphic designer and illustrator, an English language tutor, and as head of production for the children's book publisher, Toon Books.


== Career ==


=== Early work in illustration and graphic design ===
Velour moved to New York with her partner John Jacob Lee (known professionally as Johnny Velour) in 2013. She created comics and zines that she self-published and sold at conventions. Velour's work was also published in The Nib, InkBRICK, Comics Workbook Magazine, QU33R, Cicada Magazine and others, under the names Sasha Velour and Sasha Steinberg. Velour also created a comic entitled Stonewall, which attempted to tell the story of the Stonewall riots using real and fictional characters. The work was called ""a smart, beautiful and artful take on a significant and difficult historical event"" by Highlow Comics. Velour's visual art has been the subject of two solo gallery shows. A show entitled “What's Your Drag” was on display at Be Gallery NYC in spring 2014 (in connection with BeFluent, the English school where she taught), and another solo show entitled ""Nightrooms"", was held at the Black Box Gallery (located in Bizarre Bushwick) in Brooklyn in March 2016. Velour's cut paper work was part of the group show ""Coney Island Babies, Visual Artists from the Brooklyn Drag Scene"" at the Bureau of General Services Queer Division that opened in Manhattan in November 2012. In March 2017, Velour designed a long sleeve T-shirt for ""Contemporary Drag"", a limited-edition fashion line for the New Art Dealers Alliance's (NADA) in collaboration with Print All Over Me and she performed at the NADA show that month.


=== Early drag ===
Velour started performing in drag while studying at The Center for Cartoon Studies in Vermont. She also met her partner John Jacob Lee (known as Johnny Velour) in Vermont when he was acting in a production of Annie. In the spring of 2013, Velour and her partner staged Whatever She Wants, A Drag Musicale at the Main Street Museum featuring local residents. She called producing the show a ""milestone"" of her drag career and moved to Brooklyn later that year.
Velour began performing in New York City in early 2014. She founded Velour, The Drag Magazine (originally named Vym), a magazine about drag, alongside partner Johnny in the summer of 2014. The magazine included interviews as well as varied art forms such as photography, poetry, and illustration that address the power, beauty, and purpose of drag. Three issues were published over two years and the magazine was compiled into a 300-page hardcover book in 2018.
Velour began producing a monthly drag show, NightGowns, in August 2015, at Bizarre Bushwick. The show has been regularly hosted at Bizarre Bushwick and National Sawdust, both in Brooklyn New York. The shows have been celebrated as ""beautiful and funny and politically charged"" by The New York Times. It was later adapted into a TV series for Quibi.


=== RuPaul's Drag Race ===

Velour auditioned for RuPaul's Drag Race's eighth season but was not selected to participate. In 2017, she competed in and ultimately won the ninth season of the show. Velour's lip sync to Whitney Houston's ""So Emotional"" in the season finale was named “performance of the year” by The A.V. Club and was also named one of ""TV's Best Musical Moments"" by Entertainment Weekly. The lip-sync was later referenced on Saturday Night Live, during Kate McKinnon's impression of Elizabeth Warren.
During the airing of the show, Velour starred in the music video for the non-record single ""C.L.A.T."" alongside fellow New York City drag artists Peppermint, Aja and Alexis Michelle, all of whom also appeared on the ninth season of Drag Race.


=== Post-Drag Race success ===
Velour founded The House of Velour in 2017, a production company that she uses to produce stage, film work and merchandise. KC Ifeyani at Fast Company said the company was ""disrupting the business of drag"". Velour expanded her drag showcase NightGowns, moving it from Bizarre Bushwick to National Sawdust in April 2017. The show also toured to Los Angeles, London, and played at Terminal 5 in New York City, with Janet Jackson in attendance.
In 2018, Velour partnered with Opening Ceremony to host and direct their New York Fashion Week show. Velour selected 40 LGBTQ+ models to walk, creating the first all queer show in New York Fashion Week history. The show featured other notable drag performers (Lypsinka, Shea Couleé, Jiggly Caliente, Miss Fame, Farrah Moan, Hungry, and more) as well as a surprise performance from Christina Aguilera.
In 2017, Google commissioned Velour to create a Google Doodle of German singer-actress Marlene Dietrich which appeared on Google's homepage on December 27, 2017, the 116th anniversary of Dietrich's birth. Velour impersonated Dietrich in the Snatch Game challenge on season 9 of RuPaul's Drag Race. For the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising in 2019, Velour published a detailed history comic about the events of that night titled Three Dollar Riot. She had first begun working on the comic years before for her thesis project at the Center for Cartoon Studies; a previous version of the comic was published in 2012 under the name Stonewall.
Variety featured Velour in the ""Power of New York List 2019"", and she appeared in Out's annual OUT100 list twice (2017 and 2019). In June 2019, a panel of judges from New York magazine placed Velour 12th on their list of ""the most powerful drag queens in America"", a ranking of 100 former Drag Race contestants.
During a period of isolation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2021, Velour produced a series of papier-mâché masks called ""Faces of Drag"", which honors ten pioneers in ""the world history of drag"". Those highlighted by the series include Izumo no Okuni, Rebecca and Her Daughters, William Dorsey Swann, Mei Lanfang, Barbette, Josephine Baker, Coccinelle, José Sarria, and Divine.
Velour has spoken at the Teen Vogue Summit (June 2018), The Long Conversation at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. (Dec. 2018) and for colleges including Purdue, The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Columbia, Oakland University, and more. She has appeared on the covers of Wussy Mag, Plastik Magazine, Bricks, GayTimes, and she art-directed her pet Italian Greyhound, Vanya's, cover shoot of Dog Magazine which featured an interview with Velour. Her home was featured in People magazine.


=== TV and film work ===
In 2018, Velour self-produced a short film entitled Pirate Jenny, which included Velour performing her own translation of the famous The Threepenny Opera song of the same name. The work was shown as part of the group art show ""Bona Drag: An Incomplete History of Drag and Cross-Gender Performance in Film and Video Art (Part 1)"" at the Rhode Island School of Design that opened in November 2018.
In 2019, Velour appeared as herself on episodes of the television shows The Bold Type and Broad City.
Velour adapted her stage show NightGowns into an 8-episode docu-series for the short-form platform Quibi, and it premiered on April 6, 2020. She was executive producer and starred in the show, and produced it with the Documentary Group and music video director Sophie Muller. NightGowns followed Velour and a cast of drag performers across eight episodes as she transforms NightGowns into a full-blown stage act. The New York Times said it was ""among the most life-affirming shows you could find on any platform"". A second season was ordered in August 2020, but Quibi ceased operations in late 2020. In 2021, NightGowns won the RealScreen Award for ""Digital Content, Short Form Content, Non-Fiction”.
In March 2021, Velour starred in Angélica Negrón's The Island We Made, a short art-opera film commissioned by Opera Philadelphia. The film was directed by Matthew Placek. In July 2023, it was announced that Velour, alongside Priyanka and Jaida Essence Hall, would be the new hosts of the fourth season of the reality television series We're Here. The three replaced the previous hosts, Eureka, Shangela, and Bob the Drag Queen.


=== Smoke & Mirrors ===

On January 9, 2019, Velour premiered her first evening-length solo theater show, Smoke & Mirrors, in Canberra, Australia during a seven-city tour of Australia and New Zealand produced by ITD Events. The US premiere of Smoke & Mirrors was held on March 21, 2019, at New York Live Arts where it played eight sold-out shows. In May 2019, Velour performed the show at The Theatre At The Ace in Los Angeles, and on August 9 and 10, 2019, she performed two sold-out shows at the O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. The show was also performed at Purdue University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that fall.
A 23-city (24 show) tour of the US and Canada opened in San Antonio, Texas on October 21, 2019, and closed in San Francisco, California on November 30, 2019. A 16-city tour of the United Kingdom and the European Union opened on March 2, 2020, in Birmingham, England. After seven performances, the tour was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The last performance was played in Dublin, Ireland on March 11, 2020. The European tour resumed in February 2022, playing in often sold-out theaters in 36 cities in 17 countries, reaching from Ireland to Poland.
Velour was featured on the June 2023 cover of the ELLE View, or digital, edition of ELLE Brasil.


== Personal life ==
As of 2013, Velour resides in Brooklyn, New York, with partner Johnny Velour and her pet Italian greyhound, Vanya. Velour is genderfluid and uses she/they pronouns when not in drag. Her drag persona, Sasha Velour, is referred to as ""she"".
Velour has a shaved head. She often performs in drag bald, as a tribute to her mother, Jane Hedges, who died of cancer in 2015 and had lost her hair during treatment for the disease.

== Early life ==
Grady was raised in Louisville, Kentucky, by two mothers, both named Sherri. During childhood, he ran cross country for twelve years. In 2014, he graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology with a degree in advertising design.


== Career ==
Scarlet Envy first started drag in college, choosing her name from the lead character of the film Gone with the Wind, Scarlett O'Hara. She entered a drag pageant, where she learned that she didn't have the typical drag skills of dancing and pageantry. This experience, and having drag queen friends, ignited her drag career. She has credited her successful career to persistence, energy, and acceptance. Scarlet Envy is the ""drag daughter"" of Drag Race season 7 finalist Pearl.
After auditioning four times, Scarlet Envy was cast on the eleventh season of Drag Race in 2018. She won the second episode's challenge along with Yvie Oddly. She participated in a six-way lip sync on the third episode, won the mini-challenge in the fourth episode, and was eliminated on the sixth episode, after placing in the bottom two and losing a lip-sync to Ra'Jah O'Hara. Scarlet Envy returned for the sixth season of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, which aired in 2021. She placed safe in the first four episodes and was eliminated in the fifth by Ginger Minj, placing ninth overall.

In 2018, he returned as a surprise contestant for the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, placing in the top four.
His first EP, Face, was released in 2014, followed by his second EP, Kisses & Feathers, in 2017. His third EP, Broken English, was released in 2020. From 2019 to 2020, he starred in the TLC transformational makeover television series Dragnificent, as the event planning expert. In 2021, Being Bebe, a film documenting 15 years of his life, was released.


== Early life ==
Ngwa was born and raised in Cameroon. While growing up, his father played the guitar and his mother frequently sang, later inspiring him to create music. His family later moved to France where Ngwa lived until he settled in Minneapolis at age nineteen to complete his college studies and to be closer to family.


== Career ==
Benet's first experience with drag was at a Paris fashion show, where he was asked to put on a dress to walk the runway as a female as a last-minute replacement for an absent model. His first drag performance was alongside Cyndi Lauper in The Gay 90s bar after moving to Minneapolis in 2000. She has participated in drag pageants, including Miss US of A.


=== RuPaul's Drag Race and other television ===
In early 2009, Ngwa, after a suggestion from RuPaul himself after seeing him perform to ""Circle of Life"" at Minneapolis Pride, auditioned for the first season of Logo's reality-TV drag-queen competition RuPaul's Drag Race.
He eventually became one of nine queens cast in the season, having been selected out of thousands of applicants. He was the inaugural winner of the series, having won two challenges during the competition. Bebe's win would inspire many soon-to-be drag queens to pursue the art of drag, including eventual Drag Race season 8 winner Bob The Drag Queen.

In 2011, Benet appeared in two episodes of RuPaul's Drag U, serving as a ""drag professor"".
Benet was revealed as the surprise 10th contestant on the third season premiere of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, becoming the first-ever winner in the show's history to return for an All-Stars season. He reached the season finale, having won two challenges, but was not chosen to advance to the final two by a jury of previously eliminated queens and subsequently finished in joint third place with Shangela.
Benet appeared with Jujubee, Thorgy Thor, and Alexis Michelle in the TLC television special Drag Me Down the Aisle which aired on March 9, 2019, and was later picked up as a series and re-titled Dragnificent.


=== Music ===
Benet's first dance single, ""I'm the Sh*t"", has been remixed by Felix Baumgartner, Ralphi Rosario and Mark Picchiotti. He released his second single, ""Cameroon"" in July 2010. Benet made a cameo appearance in the music video for Erasure's re-release of their song A Little Respect, in December 2010 (which was a fundraiser for students of the Harvey Milk Institute in San Francisco). He released his third single ""Dirty Drums"" on April 17, 2012 via iTunes. His fourth single, ""Face,"" was released on March 3, 2014.
Benet recorded a cover of ""Little Drummer Boy"" for the Drag Race Christmas Queens 4 album.

110,"BenDeLaCreme (born September 24, 1981) is the stage persona of Benjamin Brock Hamlet Putnam, an American drag queen, burlesque performer, and actor based in Seattle, Washington. He is known for being a contestant on the sixth season of RuPaul's Drag Race and the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars. He is also known for his solo shows   Ready To Be Committed, Terminally Delightful, Inferno A-Go-Go and Cosmos, and as co-creator and host of burlesque revues Freedom Fantasia and Homo for the Holidays.


== Early life ==
Putnam grew up in Litchfield, Connecticut, attending Litchfield High School and Walnut Hill School, from which he graduated from in 2000. During his performance on Drag Race, Putnam revealed that he was bullied as a child for being overweight, ""weird"", and gay. His mother, who had been the positive voice to counteract this, died of cancer when he was 13 years old. Putnam was also open about his struggles with depression, revealing that his ""terminally delightful"" drag persona helped him overcome this.


== Artistry ==
Putnam's stage name is a play off the French term crème de la crème, which, translated, means ""cream of the cream"" or ""best of the best"", as well as a play off of his given first name. He commonly refers to himself as either ""Ben"" or ""DeLa"" to distinguish between the private, male persona (Ben) and public, female one (DeLa). He is also sometimes referred to as ""Bendela"", a take on the name Vendela. In an interview with Artes Magazine, he explained ""I consider BenDeLaCreme to be the very best of Ben which is the name of the gentleman that I share a body with. DeLa is how I refer to the lady part of me. If you say Ben you're talking to that guy. If you say DeLa you are talking to me.""
Putnam credits his interest in drag and burlesque to seeing Varla Jean Merman's Holiday Ham in Boston in 2001. He was inspired by Merman's theatrical, character-driven approach to drag performance. DeLa considers drag to be ""an inherently political act"", an opportunity to encourage people to think about complex issues related to gender and sexuality through humor and theatre. Her solo shows combine comedy, song, burlesque, dance, and video clips (often DeLa herself in other roles). DeLa's costume style is reminiscent of iconic 1950s pin-up girls. She cites dancer and actress Ann Miller as an early influence.


== Career ==

Putnam's career began in Chicago in 2002, while he was pursuing a BFA degree at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 2001 to 2003. Although his course of study focused on painting, he found himself more interested in performance art.
Her first opportunities to perform came at drag revues at Chicago-area gay bars. Early on, she was exposed to a more explicitly feminist, message-driven side of drag culture by the Chicago Kings, a drag king troupe with which she frequently performed as the token ""queen"". At the same time, DeLa made a conscious decision to present a more positive, cheerful persona during her shows, even when addressing serious subject matter such as prejudice, death, and depression.
Since the mid-2000s, she has been based in Seattle, Washington. She is the hostess for The Atomic Bombshells burlesque troupe and teaches at Seattle's Academy of Burlesque. DeLa has collaborated with many members of the Seattle burlesque community, including Drag Race Season 5 winner Jinkx Monsoon. She runs the theatrical production company DeLouRue Presents, creating and performing in popular holiday revue shows Freedom Fantasia and Homo for the Holidays, with burlesque duo Kitten La Rue and Lou Henry Hoover, her friends and frequent collaborators.
BenDeLaCreme's touring solo shows include Terminally Delightful, Cosmos, and Inferno A-Go-Go. She has also appeared in several films by filmmaker Wes Hurley, including the documentary Waxie Moon, Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel, and as a narrator of the series Capitol Hill.
At the 2019 MAC Awards, BenDeLaCreme was presented with an award in the category ""Major Impersonation/Characterization/Drag Artist"" for her show Inferno A-Go-Go.
In December 2020, BenDeLaCreme's collaboration film with Jinkx Monsoon, The Jinkx and Dela Holiday Special was released, and can be streamed on Hulu.
In 2023, BenDeLaCreme was announced to be a part of Unilever’s ""United We Stand"" program.
She has been dating Gus Lanza since 2015. She owns two cats, Wayne and Garth, and a dog, Reggie.


== RuPaul's Drag Race ==
In 2014, BenDeLaCreme appeared in the sixth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, where she placed fifth and was voted Miss Congeniality by viewers. In 2018, she appeared in the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, where, after a record-breaking fifth challenge win in episode 6, she chose to eliminate herself, claiming she had already proven herself and that she felt the other remaining contestants wanted the crown more than she did. Many fans were shocked at this decision, as her track record heavily favored her to win the entire competition. DeLa is the only Drag Race contestant so far to win five challenges in a single season, win four episodes consecutively and, at the time, win the ""Snatch Game"" challenge on more than one season (later joined by season 7 and All Stars 6 contestant Ginger Minj, as well as Season 5 and All Stars 7 contestant Jinkx Monsoon), and currently still has the best statistics of any queen to have ever competed in Drag Race.

113,"Christopher Delmar Caldwell (born June 22, 1986), also known by his stage name Caldwell Tidicue and better known by his drag name Bob the Drag Queen, is an American drag queen, comedian, actor, activist, musician, and reality television personality. He is best known for winning the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race. As of 2020, he has more than one million followers on Instagram and was the first Black Drag Race queen to reach the milestone. After Drag Race, he pursued acting, appearing in television shows such as High Maintenance (2016), Tales of the City (2019), and A Black Lady Sketch Show (2019). In 2020, he began co-hosting We're Here on HBO alongside fellow Drag Race contestants Eureka O'Hara and Shangela.


== Early life ==
Christopher Delmar Caldwell was born to Martha Caldwell on June 22, 1986. His last name, ""Caldwell"", was later incorporated into the professional name ""Caldwell Tidicue"". He was born in Columbus, Georgia. He moved a lot as a kid, which included Phenix City, Alabama, Corinth, Mississippi, LaGrange, Georgia, and Atlanta, Georgia. He was raised in Clayton County, Georgia. Caldwell explained, ""You can call it the hood. You can say it. That's where I'm from."" His mother owned a drag bar in Columbus, Georgia. On the nights that she could not afford a babysitter, she brought Caldwell to the drag bar, where he would work and collect money from the patrons.
Caldwell has described his mother as a supportive early influence on his life. He explained, ""I also grew up with a mom who told me I could do anything, so I was like, 'Y'all don't even know how amazing I am.' My mom was one of the moms who was like, 'You are so handsome why aren't you modeling? I am handsome, but model... let's not get crazy."" Bob has also been influenced by several other drag queens, such as Peppermint, Bianca Del Rio, BeBe Zahara Benet, and her Sibling Rivalry co-host Monét X Change.
As a teenager, Caldwell attended Morrow High School in Ellenwood, Georgia. He then went back to Columbus to study theater at Columbus State University. He first appeared in drag when he attended a lesbian party during Pride Month 2008.
When Caldwell was 22 years old, he moved to Queens, New York, with $500 and two suitcases. He originally intended to become an actor and standup comedian. Before becoming a drag queen, Caldwell worked in children's theater for years and ""always found children to be a source of joy for [him].""


== Career ==


=== 2009–2015: Drag career beginnings ===
In the summer of 2009, Caldwell started doing drag, after watching the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race on TiVo. He explained that he ""became obsessed"" with the show and it immediately inspired him to order a TK-7 makeup kit off of the Ben Nye website. Since his first presentations, his character was focused on stand-up comedy routines, and he started lip-syncing after a couple of months into his drag. His initial stage name was Kittin Withawhip, which was a reference to Kitten with a Whip (1964), a film that starred Ann-Margret. He was featured in Leland Bobbé's Half Drag Series with his name. In his early drag career, Caldwell would perform with a nine-foot bullwhip.
In the beginning of his career, Caldwell faced challenges as a drag queen. As he described, ""It did not make me money or get me gigs. It cost me a lot. I did this competition every Thursday. Then another one on Wednesday. And another on Tuesday. I never won any of them. Ever. After a few years, I finally won one. It was really addictive and fun doing competitions.""
In 2013, Caldwell officially changed his stage name to Bob the Drag Queen. As he explained, at a karaoke hosting gig, ""The guy goes, 'Give it up for your host... Kate. But she made light of the moment, reintroducing herself as 'Kate the Drag Queen,' then 'Kim the Drag Queen' throughout the evening. Then at the end of the night, I was like, 'Give it up for... Bob the Drag Queen.' And I was like, 'That sounds really funny.'""

== Early life ==
Barry, born July 18, 1983, to Laura Lee Everitt and Scott Prentice Barry, was raised in Modesto, California. He first saw Britney Spears when he was 15 in her ""...Baby One More Time"" music video on MTV, and first went to see her in concert in 2002. His first time in drag was when he dressed as Spears for Halloween in 2003. His second time dressing as Spears was two weeks later on November 17, 2003, at the audience of The Tonight Show where Spears was a guest star. Derrick was the 2010 representative for a National anti-bullying organization Don't H8 as Miss Don't H8 DIVA where he was also awarded Hall of Fame, LEGEND Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, and Presidential Hall of Champions.

He was brought on stage by Madonna during one of her performances on her Rebel Heart Tour in 2015.
It was announced that Barry would be competing with 11 other drag queens for the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race on February 1, 2016.

She competed in Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World in 2022.


== Early life ==
Kennedy-Hall was born in Yeovil, England and moved to Auckland at age 10. He completed a Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Music (Honours) in music performance (with first class honours) at University of Auckland and a Masters of Music degree at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, before returning to New Zealand and joining the Royal New Zealand Navy Band as a trumpet player.

116,"James Heath-Clark (born August 13, 1985), known professionally as Honey Davenport, is an American drag performer, singer, songwriter, actor and activist. Davenport was a longtime fixture of the New York City nightlife scene and came to international attention as a contestant on season 11 of RuPaul's Drag Race. Born in West Philadelphia, Heath-Clark attended college for musical theatre in New York, where he began his career as a backup dancer for Peppermint. He later established his own dance group, The Hunties. After taking up drag, Davenport became active in the pageant circuit of that community, winning 18 titles between 2013 and 2018. In 2013, she and her band, Electrohoney, released an eponymous album and starred in a live rock opera called The Electric Highway. She also performed in two off-Broadway shows, The Orion Experience (2013) and Trinkets (2017–2018). In the latter, she played the leading role.
While her season of Drag Race aired in 2019, Davenport released singles and music videos off of her debut EP, Raw and Unfiltered. Since then, she has launched a solo musical career; embarked on domestic and international tours; and appeared as both a host and a guest on web series about drag, culture and current events. In the second half of 2019, she starred in two off-off-Broadway shows: Raw and Unfiltered, a live adaptation of her EP, and Stocking Stuffer: A Christmas Show with Balls, a holiday-themed performance. In early 2020, she and Aja released ""Draw the Blood"", a song whose accompanying music video marked her first directorial credit. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Davenport has produced more songs, music videos and web content, sometimes in collaboration with other artists. Her second EP, Love Is God, was released in January 2022, and she followed this with a single and music video titled ""Mighty Legendary"" in 2023. In film, she co-starred in God Save the Queens, a feature-length picture that debuted at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 2023.
Davenport centers most of her art on social justice themes. She was motivated to take up political activism for a number of reasons: losing family and friends to gun violence as a child, being the victim of police brutality as a young adult, and experiencing incidents of racism throughout life. She has also been vocal about transgender rights, especially within the drag community. In October 2018, Davenport attracted national media attention for quitting her longtime job as a show host at The Monster, a Manhattan gay bar, in protest of racism she encountered there.


== Early life ==

Heath-Clark was born James Clark on August 13, 1985, in West Philadelphia. He was raised primarily by his mother, who taught him to express his feelings by rapping. Of his early years, he said, ""I grew up ... in the projects, and I lost countless family members and friends to gun violence. I have been held at gunpoint more than once. It's the world I grew up in, [guns] were so easily accessible to my friends and to my enemies.""
Affected by those experiences and by racism he encountered, Heath-Clark began writing poetry about social justice when he was 10 years old. Also interested in music, he was a member of his church choir and started writing songs at 13. He practiced boxing as a childhood hobby and took up spoken word poetry as a teenager. In high school, he was in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC), where he achieved the rank of squadron commander and served as captain of his rifle team. While attending the Pennsylvania Governor's School for the Arts when he was 15, Heath-Clark and a female friend went to a ""come as you are not"" party costumed as one another; he cites this as his first time dressing in drag. At 17, he moved to New York City to study musical theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. For a time, he lived in Harlem, on the same block as Drag Race season 6 contestant Vivacious, season 2 contestant Sahara Davenport and season 9 runner-up Peppermint.


=== Path to drag ===
After college, Heath-Clark was in the cast of the Broadway national tour of Hairspray. It was there that he had his first experience with drag as a performance art, and this motivated him to subsequently take up work as a backup dancer for Peppermint for four years. He also danced in music videos for Sherry Vine. In anticipation of a month-long tour of Europe with Peppermint in 2008, Heath-Clark decided to earn spending money for his travels by putting on dance shows with a friend; the two called their act The Hunties. To encourage people from the drag community to attend their shows, they incorporated elements of drag into their routines. After his friend left to pursue other endeavors, Heath-Clark decided to continue performing alone as a drag queen. Shortly before the group disbanded, he met RuPaul at a book signing, where the latter misheard the name of The Hunties and made out an autograph to ""Honey"". From this, Heath-Clark took Honey as his drag name, adopting the Davenport surname from his drag mother, Lady Deja Davenport, who had recently begun mentoring him. His neighbor Sahara Davenport, who had the same drag mother as Deja and was therefore his drag aunt, also taught him tricks of the trade. He credits both Sahara and her partner, Manila Luzon, as teachers who influenced his style. He cites Kevin Aviance, Phylicia Rashad and Beyoncé as artistic inspirations. Heath-Clark's first performance in drag was on April 20, 2008, and his first paid appearance as Honey Davenport was at a show with Bob the Drag Queen. Early in his career, when his aesthetic was more androgynous, Heath-Clark went by the name Sir Honey Davenport. He dropped the ""Sir"" as his look became more feminine.


== Career ==


=== Nightlife and pageantry ===

Davenport has hosted regular drag shows in New York City, in New Jersey, on Fire Island and in Key West. She also works as a DJ. For her contributions to queer New York City nightlife, she has received six Glam Awards—prizes à la the Oscars issued to members of that community in an annual ceremony. The categories she has won include Club Party of the Year (2017), Door Goddess (2017 and 2018), Best Hostess (2019) and Best Video (2020). She was also named Music Artist of the Year at the 2020 edition of GIANT Fest, a queer music festival in Brooklyn.
Prior to appearing on Drag Race, Davenport was a frequent competitor in drag pageants, where she amassed a total of 18 titles by 2018. The first pageant she ever competed in was Miss Stonewall, which she attempted four times before winning in 2015. Fourteen of her victories fell in the three-year period between 2013 and 2016. Notable among these was the national crown of Miss'd America 2015. Concurrent with that reign, she held seven other titles. In February 2018, Davenport won the Miss Paradise pageant in Asbury Park, New Jersey. She had been performing at Paradise, the nightclub that hosts that pageant, since Sahara Davenport first brought her there years earlier.


=== Early music, theatre and television work ===
In the early 2010s, Davenport fronted Electrohoney, a synth-pop band that released an eponymous album in 2013. Shortly after the album's completion, the band created and starred in The Electric Highway, a live, interactive rock opera featuring  a soundtrack of their songs. Set in 2092 New York, The Electric Highway's narrative focuses on Davenport (playing herself) as she embarks on a quest to become a legend. The production explores themes related to gender and sexuality in a dystopian future. All three members of Electrohoney—Davenport, SteveX and Jesse Gray—as well as Deja Davenport, Sherry Vine and Jeremy Xtravaganza, played major roles. J. C. Alvarez of EDGE Media Network reviewed the show favorably, also noting that its opening night suffered from technical problems. Of the musical as a whole, he said, ""What Electrohoney and company deliver with their musical rock-opera is a joyful reminder of the creativity that once thrived on the Lower East Side's underground club scene of the 80's, which disappeared into the mass consumer-driven 90's, and totally vanished during the height of the AIDS epidemic.""

In summer 2013, Davenport acted in the off-Broadway show The Orion Experience, a sci-fi musical directed by Travis Greisler and set to a glam rock soundtrack by The Orion Experience. In its plot, that band's lead singer, Orion Simprini, goes on an intergalactic journey wherein he encounters various fantastical characters, including Davenport in her role of The Queen of White Lies. The play was well received both by critics and by the audience. A Theater Mania review summarized the show as being ""like Here Lies Love or Fuerza Bruta, but with robots and space aliens instead of Filipina dictators or sexually ambiguous Argentineans."" Greg Solomon of Theasy.com wrote, ""The Orion Experience would appeal to anyone who is out to have a good time, regardless of their walk of life. The age range [of the audience] was from early 20s to late 70s and no one seemed out of place. The only complaint I can muster is that it could have lasted longer."" Both The Electric Highway and The Orion Experience ran at the XL Nightclub in New York City.
In 2015, Davenport and Orion collaborated again, this time producing a single called ""T.R.O.U.B.L.E"". The same year, she appeared on an episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen as a Whitney Houston impersonator. From 2017 to 2018, Davenport had the leading role in Trinkets, an off-Broadway play about the lives of transsexual sex workers in Manhattan's Meatpacking District in the 1990s. She portrayed Diva, a veteran prostitute who takes another character under her wing. The show was directed by Paul E. Alexander of The Ones, also starred Kevin Aviance, and ran at the Gene Frankel Theatre. Reviews were mixed: Adrienne Sowers of The Reviews Hub criticized Trinkets as lacking energy and plot cohesion, but she said the script had promise. Gay City News called the play ""an ultimately euphoric but often sobering musical that shines a well-lit, long-overdue spotlight on drag and transsexual prostitutes during an era of uneasy cultural visibility"".


=== RuPaul's Drag Race ===

After auditioning for RuPaul's Drag Race eight times, Davenport was selected as one of 15 contestants for the show's 11th season, which premiered on February 28, 2019. The invitation to compete came at a difficult time for her: she was homeless and having troubles in her marriage, and one of her mentors was in a coma. She borrowed about $20,000 from friends in order to commission the runway outfits she brought to the competition. For the season's first main challenge, a photo shoot, she was paired with her mentor Manila Luzon, who placed as runner-up on the third season of Drag Race and competed on the first and fourth seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. Davenport was eliminated in the series' first-ever six-way Lip Sync for Your Life, exiting in season 11's third episode as the 13th-place finisher.
One of Davenport's drag daughters, Monét X Change, competed on the 10th season of RuPaul's Drag Race and won the fourth season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. Two of Davenport's drag aunts have also appeared on the show: Sahara Davenport, who competed on season 2 of the regular series, and Kennedy Davenport, who competed on season 7 of the regular series and placed as runner-up on season 3 of All Stars. Fellow season 11 contestants Ra'Jah O'Hara and A'keria C. Davenport are also members of the Davenport drag family.


=== Raw and Unfiltered ===

Davenport's 2019 visual EP, Raw and Unfiltered, treats the subject of being a queer person of color in America. It was produced by Chew Fu. Davenport released each of the songs from Raw and Unfiltered during the airing of Drag Race season 11; the corresponding music videos showcase the looks she would have worn in the episodes following her elimination from the show. The first single and video combination off the EP, titled ""The Hive"", came out during the second week of the season. Davenport co-wrote ""The Hive"" with Jayse Vegas, a frequent collaborator who has featured her in his own songs and music videos. The fifth track on Raw and Unfiltered, ""Cocoa Butter"", was co-produced by Davenport; Vegas; Will Sheridan; Nedra Belle (of The Voice season 13); and Kareem McJagger, another longtime collaborator who is also Davenport's drag daughter. The video for ""Cocoa Butter"" won a Glam Award. The final track on Raw and Unfiltered, ""Worship Me"", was written by Orion Simprini. In July 2019, Davenport performed a theatrical concert adaptation of Raw and Unfiltered at the Laurie Beechman Theatre, an off-off-Broadway venue in Manhattan. The show had a three-date run.


=== 2019: Post-Drag Race endeavors ===
In spring 2019, Davenport released the first season of her weekly YouTube series and podcast, Da Fuq. That May, she released ""Stan for You"", a Pride-themed single and music video featuring Drag Race season 11 winner Yvie Oddly. Over the summer, she participated in the RuPaul's Drag Race Season 11 Tour, performing around the U.S. with other competitors from her season. She had an out-of-drag cameo role in Eureka O'Hara's August 2019 music video ""Pretty Hot and Tasty"". The first week in September, Davenport was featured on the cover of Get Out! Magazine. The issue included a piece she wrote about the life changes she underwent after Drag Race. Around the same time, she appeared in the music video for Lovari and Adam Barta's song ""No Day Like Today"".
Davenport traveled to Australia in October 2019 to partake in Pride events and raise awareness for queer people of color on that continent. In an interview with DNA magazine, she said, ""It is really important to me that my people are represented all over the world. People of colour are a part of every community not just in America and the people here are just as important to me as the ones back home."" During the visit, she appeared at the first-ever Black Pride Awards in Cairns, becoming the first RuPaul's Drag Race alumna to perform in that city. After the activism leg of her trip, she joined six other Drag Race season 11 contestants and season 2 runner-up Raven for The Sickening Ball tour, a Halloween-themed drag production with stops in Australia and New Zealand.
In November 2019, Trustpilot, a consumer review website, unveiled an ad campaign featuring Davenport on billboards and in a commercial. In the campaign, a female monarch resembling Queen Elizabeth II purchases jewelry online, guided by Davenport's product review. Later that month, Davenport and Peppermint served as guest panelists on the VH1 online miniseries Black Girl Beauty. The series takes the form of a round-table discussion that ""gives celebrities, influencers and VH1 stars an opportunity to have their say on issues that define [b]lack women's beauty"". During the 2019 holiday season, Davenport starred in Stocking Stuffer: A Christmas Show with Balls, her second one-woman show at the Laurie Beechman Theatre. Its closing night was held at Club Cumming. On Christmas Eve 2019, she released a single called ""Present (Tie You Down)"".


=== 2020–2021: Music and online content during the COVID-19 pandemic ===

In February 2020, Davenport and Aja released ""Draw the Blood"", a collaborative single whose music video marked Davenport's first directorial credit. The song, which debuted at number 26 on iTunes, focuses on the danger of bystander inaction in the face of racism, and its video features the personal experiences of Davenport and those close to her. The title references a metaphor indicating that those who do not intervene when they witness injustice have blood on their hands. Aja and Davenport each penned portions of the track, and Kareem McJagger wrote the hook. The video was included in Entertainment Weekly's ""fabulous collection of the RuPaul's Drag Race queens' best music videos"".
The second season of Da Fuq premiered in April 2020. The same month, Jayse Vegas featured Davenport in a remix of his song ""Energy"", and Mo Heart featured her in the music video ""Hot Sauce and High Heels (Kinky Boots Remix)"". In May 2020, Billboard called Davenport's performance at RuPaul's Digital DragCon one of the seven best moments of the event. In June, she was featured in Socia(Lites)'s music video ""Bitch Got Hips"". Later that month, she debuted ""Digital Rainbow"", a single about celebrating Pride in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The track features Oddly, Vegas, Widow Von'Du and Cazwell. Both the song and its accompanying music video were produced while Davenport and the featured artists were in quarantine; each person recorded their portion of the sound and video at home, and the clips were stitched together in post-production.
In August 2020, Davenport appeared in ""Nerves of Steel"", a music video by the English synth-pop duo Erasure. The video is a mashup of clips of prominent drag queens and other queer performers lip-syncing the song's lyrics. Later in the summer, she served as assistant director for Shuga Cain's September 2020 music video ""Sweet Love"". Because filming was completed in person during the pandemic, the video's cast is mostly masked. Shortly thereafter, Davenport re-released ""Warrior"", the second single off of Raw and Unfiltered, together with a full-length music video filmed in front of a green screen during quarantine. The video accompanying the song's initial release had been shorter due to budgetary restrictions.
In October, the cast of Shooting Star – A Revealing New Musical featured Davenport, Alaska Thunderfuck and Miss Coco Peru in a music video medley ""to raise COVID-19 relief aid for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and Pineapple Support"". The same month, Davenport appeared in Divas for Democracy: United We Slay, a digital variety show featuring Broadway names like Chita Rivera and Harvey Fierstein as well as Drag Race stars including Bianca Del Rio, Jinkx Monsoon and Jujubee. The show encouraged Americans to vote in the 2020 United States presidential election. Shortly before Halloween, Davenport and Loris (of The Boulet Brothers' Dragula) released a collaborative single and music video called ""Freaky Planet"".
As of February 2021, Davenport hosted a monthly Twitch show called Something of a Different Color, which featured a cast of POC performers. The third season of Da Fuq premiered in May of that year.


=== 2022–present: Love Is God, God Save the Queens and other projects ===

In November 2021, Davenport and Manila Luzon released a collaborative single and music video called ""Love Is God"", the first song off of Davenport's five-track EP of the same name, which debuted in January 2022. Love Is God spans genres including pop, disco, house and reggaeton, and it features collaborations with Kevin Aviance, LaLa Ri, Jackie Cox and Tammie Brown. The music video for ""Thrive"", the track with Aviance, was released together with the EP. A short musical film titled Love Is God: The Visual Album, consisting of ""a story woven together by all the songs on the EP"", was scheduled to come out later in 2022. Davenport directed the film.
Davenport co-starred (as herself) in God Save the Queens, a feature-length film that premiered at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 2023. The film ""[follows] three different Drag Queens, in LA, New York and Las Vegas, all navigating their way through their careers and personal struggles"".
In June 2023, Davenport debuted a single called ""Mighty Legendary"". A ""Legends Only"" remix of the song, featuring Alaska Thunderfuck, was released with an accompanying music video in September of that year. The video, sponsored by the online PrEP provider Mistr, was partially filmed at the Trixie Motel.
Davenport is to release a line of perfume called Pollen 8 and a makeup line called Bee Yourself. She is also working on a musical collaboration with Jan Sport and a podcast called The Wake and Bake with Jasmine Masters.


== Activism ==

Davenport has said that it is important to her to use her career in drag to help others, and she often bases her looks, performances and music on political themes. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she stated, ""I like to use my drag as a platform for the voiceless; for women, people of color, and those who aren't being heard."" She further said to KCRW that drag has ""become a protest, because now when I go to work, I'm doing this in spite of what might happen to me"". Davenport has been particularly outspoken about racial equality and gun control, motivated by the impact that racism and gun violence have had on her life since childhood.

In November 2018, Davenport led the We Vote parade, a procession through New York City that encouraged Americans to vote in the 2018 midterm elections. The final runway look she wore on Drag Race was an homage to an outfit Lady Gaga wore while performing ""Angel Down"", a tribute to Trayvon Martin. In fall 2019, Davenport and other former Miss'd America titleholders spoke out against the pageant's decision to introduce a rule banning trans women from competing. Davenport told Instinct magazine: Being Miss'd America is one of my favorite accomplishments. I enjoyed being able to stand for a community in need, and being able to use my art to help the LGBT folks of Atlantic City. While I will forever be moved and appreciative of the work done by the Greater Atlantic City LGBT Alliance [the charity that organizes the pageant], I no longer agree with some of the policies of the Miss'd America Pageant. ...  It has taken me some time, but have  [sic] decided I can no longer support them while that policy is in place. I want it to be clear that this is no boycott; I will no longer be a a  [sic] judge and won't be a part of crowning, but I am going to support my friends competing. I know how much being Miss'd America cultivated the queen I am today, and I want that for all of my sisters.... I believe every member and supporter of the LGBT community should be able compete for this prestigious title.
On the subject of Drag Race's lack of trans contestants, Davenport said, ""[I]t is all of our responsibility to deal with that. I don't think that it's wise for us to point the finger. It's Drag Race's opportunity to accept trans people, but it's all of our social obligation to create this platforms  [sic].""
At the start of the 2020 George Floyd protests, Davenport teamed up with two fellow New York City drag queens, Dèvo Monique and Marti Gould Cummings, to ask every queer venue in the city to pledge to hire more black staff and entertainment. In a June 2020 interview, she described an incident in which she was subjected to police brutality in Harlem. She said that roughly ten years earlier (c. 2010), she had been on her way to the supermarket when she was apprehended by police officers, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed. One officer placed a knee on her neck while another searched her. When they did not find anything on her person, they told her they had stopped her because her profile matched a description they had received. Davenport asked the officers if they would apologize for what they had done to her, and they replied, ""You should be happy you're not going to jail today."" The event served as one of the inspirations for ""Draw the Blood"", which features a reenactment of Davenport's encounter with the police in its music video.
On Easter Sunday in 2023, Davenport and Drag Race season 14 contestant Kerri Colby performed at Drag March Los Angeles, a demonstration organized by the Los Angeles LGBT Center against anti-LGBT legislation.


=== Monster Bar controversy ===
In September and October 2018, Davenport was at the center of a controversy over racist practices at The Monster, a popular gay bar in New York City's West Village, where she had hosted a weekly show called ""Manster"" for six years. The incident began in late September 2018, when bar manager Italo Lopez sent text messages to Davenport's manager, DJ Mitch Ferrino, indicating that a flyer for ""Manster"" appeared to be promoting a ""black night"" and that this was bad for business. Lopez also said that the two black dancers on the flyer needed to be replaced by someone ""beautiful"" and that the image of Davenport herself needed to be smaller. After Ferrino showed Davenport the messages, she reached out to bar owner Charles Rice with concerns about the overtones of Lopez's words, but Rice did not respond. Following this, on September 29, 2018, Davenport appeared at ""Manster"" as planned. However, instead of performing, she announced she would no longer be able to work at The Monster. She shared what Lopez had said with the audience and ended her two-minute speech by stating, ""I cannot be a part of this anymore. If you don't want my people at the party, I won't be here.""
Shortly thereafter, a number of other drag queens canceled their regular shows at The Monster. Ferrino also withdrew his weekly event LookQueen, which was started in 2014 by Bob the Drag Queen, from the bar. LookQueen's acting host, Shuga Cain, had urged Ferrino to do so. Rice initially blamed Ferrino and Davenport for the backlash he experienced, calling the incident a smear campaign that he ascribed to Ferrino ""[having] an axe to grind with [Lopez]"". He further stated that he believed Ferrino should not have shown Lopez's messages to Davenport, chalking up their content to a miscommunication stemming from Lopez's non-native English. Later on, Rice apologized, and Lopez resigned from his position. Rice arranged for staff at The Monster to undergo racial sensitivity training, but he declined Davenport's invitation to have a moderated public discussion about the matter.


== Personal life ==
Having known he was gay for most of his life, Heath-Clark said, ""The first person I ever came out to was my godfather and math teacher—my Uncle John. He overheard me in the classroom being attacked for my sexual orientation, and afterwards, he promised me that even if what he heard was true, he would always have my back."" Heath-Clark came out to his mother at age 19, when he called her to talk after breaking up with his first boyfriend. Her response was supportive. Though she embraced him as a gay man, she was initially unhappy with his decision to pursue drag, but she changed her mind after seeing him perform. Heath-Clark's father learned he was a drag queen years later, in 2013, when he visited New York to see Heath-Clark act in The Orion Experience. He responded with enthusiasm and support.
Heath-Clark and his husband, John, wed on December 31, 2012, at the Hartley House in Hell's Kitchen. The two have a pet cat. Heath-Clark resided in New York City until late 2019, when he relocated to Los Angeles following the airing of his season of Drag Race. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, he continued to work in both cities, traveling regularly between them. Hollywood director Lee Daniels, who created the television series Empire and produced the films Monster's Ball and Precious, is Heath-Clark's cousin.
Heath-Clark identifies as non-binary and pansexual. As of May 2020, he keeps a vegan diet. He stopped drinking alcohol a few months after filming Drag Race but later resumed its consumption. He has stated that he suffers from anxiety.

Rezaul Kabir (Tanveer Ghani), the cousin of Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh), is introduced in December. Additionally, multiple other characters appear throughout the year.


== John Fisher ==

John Fisher, played by Dave Dale, is a drag queen who is hired by publican Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) in January 1986 to perform for the premier drag night at The Queen Victoria public house. Following the publicity over Angie's drink driving case, she and her husband, Den (Leslie Grantham), worry that the brewery who owns the pub might find cause to cancel their tenancy, and 'free entertainment' is seen as a way to bolster the evening trade.
The first drag night is a success until Pete Beale (Peter Dean) starts heckling the performer. John mistakes Pete's intent, thinking he wants to join in with the act. John playfully takes Pete's pint on-stage and Pete leaps after it, causing a tussle to ensue. Seconds later, Den finds himself on the floor breaking up the pair. The surprise arrival of Den's mistress, Jan Hammond (Jane How), prompts Den to close the pub early, so the act is halted prematurely.
Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) is quite impressed with the drag artiste and thinks him to be a caring and sensitive person. When he mentions that his other job is delivering 'kiss-o-grams', she hatches a plan for starting her own business. John performs several more drag evenings in The Vic. His last appearance is on 27 February 1986.


== Jan Hammond ==

Jan Hammond, played by Jane How, appears in 1986 as the long-term mistress of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Jan is considered by the locals as a posh upper-class sort of woman and works at an art gallery. Den has an affair with her while he is still married to Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). She is always hated by Angie and Den's adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) but she tries her best to get along with her. She moves into The Queen Victoria at one point on Den's insistence, but is not much of a landlady so moves out soon after. Den tries to leave Angie for Jan so he tells Angie he is leaving her. Angie grows desperate and to stop him from leaving her she tells him that she only has six months to live. Den believes her but discovers many months later that she is lying while they are on holiday in Venice. Den serves Angie divorce papers on Christmas Day 1986.
Eventually, Jan grows tired of Den not having a proper relationship with her, so she ends their affair after he refuses to leave Walford with her. She leaves Walford in 1987 and goes on to marry a man called Dario Chimisso (Marino Mase) on a gondola in Venice. She makes a brief return in 2002 for Angie's funeral. She returns to give Sharon a portrait that Den had left with her many years earlier. She briefly returns again in 2003 in a lead-up to Den's return 14 years since he has been shot and presumed dead by an employee of the gangland organisation The Firm. Den's long lost son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) tracks Jan down and she reveals that Den had survived the shooting and came to her for help. With her help, Den was able to flee to Spain to protect himself and his family.


== Brad Williams ==

Brad Williams, played by Jonathan Stratt, is a mobster heavy for the East End gangster organisation known as The Firm. He is of low importance within the organisation and is generally used as an errand boy. He is first seen in March 1986 and over the next two years he appears occasionally to inform Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) of his bosses' orders. Den works in league with the Firm on a variety of dodgy dealings.
Towards the end of 1987 Brad is instructed to scare graphic designer Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), who is a jury member in a trial for an associate of the Firm. Brad and Den put pressure on Colin to give a verdict of 'not guilty' at the trial, and when he refuses Brad steals his keys and vandalises his flat, causing all sorts of problems for Colin.
During 1988 Brad is seen more frequently, turning up to aid the running of the Firm's business in Walford, Strokes winebar, which is being managed by Den and is really a front for an illegal gambling den. The petty criminal Darren Roberts (Gary McDonald) manages to get on the wrong side of Brad when he tries to play him off against the owner of The Dagmar, James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde). The Firm's money lending business, 'Walford Investments', are in the process of securing the takeover of James' ailing winebar, albeit against his wishes. Darren, sensing an opportunity, promises to provide James protection against the Firm, whilst all the while attempting to get onto the Firm's payroll via Brad. Incensed by Darren's audacity, Brad takes him aside and gives him a severe beating, and Darren leaves Walford shortly after.
In July 1988, Den discovers Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) after she had been raped by James Wilmott-Brown, and instantly seeks revenge. He demands retribution from his contacts within the Firm, Brad and Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), and is enraged when they refused to act. Den manages to persuade Brad to help him anyway by conning him into thinking that James' downfall will please his bosses and Den watches with glee as the Dagmar burns down in flames. However the resulting police investigation puts the Firm's business in serious jeopardy. They then decide that to put a halt to the investigation either Brad or Den have to take the blame for the arson attack. Neither Brad nor Den is willing to take the blame, and both are then involved in a personal war to persuade the other to take the rap.
Brad immediately calls on the services of Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem), via threats, and forces him to give the police a tip off about Den. The police begin questioning Den and realising that he has gotten in way over his head, he decides that he will accept the blame for the arson, but instead of serving time in prison, he decides to flee the country to avoid arrest. The Firm agree to this and Den is taken into hiding. However the Firm subsequently set up a hit on Den, which fails when he escapes from hiding and turns himself into the police to avoid the Firm's heavies.
As the Firm busy themselves with ways in which to silence Den from inside, Brad causes more grief by doing a bit of moonlighting; breaking into several people's houses on the Square with an accomplice who works as a cab driver for Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih). The burglaries result in a greater police presence in the area. The Firm are not impressed and Gregory Mantel (Pavel Douglas) – a superior member of the Firm – threatens Brad with serious repercussions should his deviance continue. Brad stops the burglaries, but his accomplice continues without him and is eventually caught by the police and is quick to implicate Brad. The investigating officer, D.I. Ashley, decides to use this piece of information to manipulate the dimwitted Brad. He threatens to put him in prison unless he acts as an informant. Brad is forced to relay information on The Firm. Strokes is closed down as a result and various members of the Firm are arrested. With the Firm under threat from the police, Gregory Mantel decides that Den has to be the informant and makes arrangements to have him eliminated.
On the day of Den's trial, Mantel's heavies break Den out of custody and take him to the Firm's headquarters, where he is greeted by Brad. Brad imprisons him in a room to await the arrival of Mantel. However, Den is not about to go down without a fight and knowing how easily influenced Brad is, he makes one last attempt to secure his freedom. He plays upon Brad's fears, relaying that he had heard that Brad is to be the next victim on the Firm's hit-list. Brad is easily swayed and he decides to help Den escape. He lures the other gang member, Marco, into the cell where an awaiting Den jumps him and throws him to the floor, whilst Brad locks him up in Den's place. The two then escape from the headquarters, and Brad speeds off in his car, leaving Den to fend for himself.
Brad immediately goes to the police and hands himself in. He promises to confess everything he knows regarding the arson, Den, and the Firm. Meanwhile, Mantel, who is furious with Brad's betrayal, tracks Den down, he is shot and presumed dead for over 14 years. However he returns to Walford in 2003, revealing that he had faked his own death to secure his survival. It is also revealed that a man named Brad has been charged for the arson attack of the Dagmar. Subsequently, Den is no longer wanted by the police.


== Charlie Cotton ==

Charlie Cotton, played by Christopher Hancock, is a recurring character, introduced in March 1986 as the estranged husband of Dot Cotton (June Brown). He appears in stints until producers made the decision to kill the character off-screen in 1991, to aid development of characters connected to him. June Brown was openly against the killing of Charlie. Charlie appears one last time, in October 2000, as an apparition, warning his son Nick to change his ways. Charlie comes and goes throughout his duration in the show; he is first seen 13 months after the soap's launch in 1986. Depicted as bigamous and a conman, Charlie typically reappears in the show whenever he needs money or temporary accommodation and, because of Dot's Christian ideals regarding forgiveness, Charlie always is permitted to return. According to Christopher Hancock, Charlie is ""a truly revolting character, a loser"" and the character has been described as a ""despicable small-time villain [...] lazy and pathetic"". Author Kate Lock has described Charlie as a ""sly, shifty, weaselly man"". To become the character of Charlie, Hancock wore stick-on sideburns.


== James Willmott-Brown ==

James Willmott-Brown, played by William Boyde, is an ex-army officer, arriving in Albert Square in March 1986 as the area manager for 'Luxford and Copley', the brewery that owns The Queen Victoria. By December, he decides to move to the square and buys Debbie Wilkins's (Shirley Cheriton) house at 43 Albert Square when she sells it following her fiancé, Andy's (Ross Davidson), death. He and Debbie later have a fling, but it doesn't progress into anything serious. Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) takes a shine to him and tries seducing him on several occasions, but is rebuffed each time. During the early years, he is friendly with Colin Russell (Michael Cashman).


== Vicki Fowler ==

Vicki Fowler, played by Emma Herry from the character's birth in 1986 to 1988, Samantha Leigh Martin from 1988 to 1995, and Scarlett Johnson from 2003 to 2004, is the daughter of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). The character is born in the serial, and was conceived in a controversial storyline about teenage pregnancy. Exploiting a whodunnit angle, at the time of the first showing, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 in episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. 4 possible suspects are seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point, a car pulls up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leap out of a car and give it all away: Den Watts is the father Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream. The character of Vicki was written out in 1995, after the actress who played Vicki's mother decided to leave the soap. After an 8-year absence, she was reintroduced by Executive Producer Louise Berridge in 2003 as a rebellious teenager.


== Carmel Jackson ==

Carmel Jackson (also Roberts), played by Judith Jacob, is a health visitor, introduced in a recurring, minor role in 1986. Producers saw potential in the character. Script writers were asked to develop more prominent storylines, and Carmel became a regular character. She is portrayed as a well-meaning, caring individual who is forever getting everyone's problems dumped on her. She is featured in storylines about domestic violence and various family and career upsets. Jacob remained in the role until 1989, when she opted to leave. Off-screen, the character has been the subject of criticism regarding the portrayal of her profession from the Health Visitors Association. In July 1984, before EastEnders went to air, the show's creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, attended an opening evening at the Anna Scher Theatre School in North London, to find actors for roles in their upcoming serial. According to Holland and Smith, Anna Scher's school was unlike many other drama schools, where students were ""ironed out"", all looking and sounding the same. At Anna Scher's school, students' natural personalities and accents were encouraged, ""her students aren't taught how to act, they're helped to dig inside themselves and be."" In Holland and Smith's own words, this was ""just the sort of non-acting that [EastEnders] was looking for"".


== Harry Reynolds ==

Harry Reynolds, played by Gareth Potter, is a college friend of Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford) who first appears along with Tessa Parker (Josephine Melville) in June 1986. Both Harry and Tessa have radical Marxist beliefs and it isn't long before they manage to recruit Kelvin to the same way of thinking.


== Tessa Parker ==

Tessa Parker, played by Josephine Melville, is a college friend of Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford) and Harry Reynolds (Gareth Potter) who first appears in June 1986. Both Harry and Tessa have radical Marxist beliefs and it isn't long before they manage to recruit Kelvin to the same way of thinking. Tessa soon discovers that she and Kelvin have more in common than their beliefs. She finds him attractive and they start dating.


== Pat Butcher ==

Pat Evans (also Wicks and Butcher) is played by Pam St. Clement from 1986 to 2016. Pat is also played by Emma Cooke in a soap 'bubble' Pat and Mo: Ashes to Ashes, delving into her past with sister-in-law Mo Harris, which first aired in 2004. Pat is the third-longest-running character in the soap, coming after Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who has featured in the soap since it first aired, and Dot Branning (June Brown). The character of Pat was conceived by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, in 1984. Although not one of the serial's original protagonists, Pat is referred to in the character outline of Pete Beale, who appeared on-screen in EastEnders first episode, as written by Smith and Holland in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story: ""[Pete] married very young to Pat – it turned out to be a total disaster. They were too young, rushing into a difficult life for all the wrong reasons, and truthfully, [Pat] was a vicious shrew...[Pete] divorced [Pat] and married Kathy when he was 24...His two sons by his first marriage are nineteen and twenty and he hardly sees them..."" On 7 July 2011, it was announced that St. Clement had quit EastEnders. The actress revealed that she wanted to try other things, saying ""I have enjoyed 25 and a half wonderful years in EastEnders creating the character of Pat but feel it's time to hang up her earrings. Leaving the EastEnders 'family' will be akin to a bereavement. But I'm looking forward to the other work and life opportunities that I will have the time to pursue."" Pat left later in the year and executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said her departure was a ""fitting"" storyline. Pat's son David Wicks (Michael French) returned for her departure.


== Eddie Hunter ==

Eddie Hunter, played by Simon Henderson, is a flamboyantly dressed friend of Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and he is first seen in Albert Square in June 1986. Eddie and Simon were part of a band, and before Simon came to Walford, he had borrowed money from loan sharks and was left owing them huge amounts of money that he couldn't pay back. Eddie was happy to leave Simon with the debt and disappeared to work as a redcoat in Clacton, so the band dissolved. However, when the debts are finally repaid, Simon decides to regroup and he contacts Eddie to rejoin the band. The reformed group, known as ""The Banned"", consist of Simon, Eddie, Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Harry Reynolds (Gareth Potter). Eddie is the lead guitarist.


== Irene ==

Irene (credited as Aunty Irene), played by Katherine Parr, is the aunt of Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) – his mother's sister. Lofty does not have a close relationship with his stern mother, but he dotes on his aunt Irene and she is the only relative he has contact with.
untie Irene first appears in July 1986, when her nephew Lofty and his fiancée Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) visit her in the nursing home where she lives. She has been told that she only had six months to live, as she has terminal cancer. She tells Michelle that she had been in love with a man in 1938, but he was killed in an accident and she had never married.
She attends Lofty and Michelle's wedding in September 1986, only to see her beloved nephew jilted at the altar. Later in the year Lofty and Michelle sort out their differences and finally get married. Irene worries that Michelle is merely using Lofty, but Michelle promises she will not hurt him. Satisfied, Irene gives their union her blessing and also pays for their honeymoon as a wedding gift.
Irene visits Lofty and Michelle in March 1987, giving Lofty instructions about her funeral. Irene worries that Lofty will not cope once she has gone and tries to make him accept that she will soon be dead. Lofty is distressed at the prospect of losing his aunt and cries into her lap. In June 1987 Lofty visits Irene at the hospital. She is in obvious pain and can no longer see. The following episode Lofty hears that his aunt has finally succumbed to the cancer that had been slowly killing her for years. He attends her funeral on 23 June 1987.


== Colin Russell ==

Colin Russell, played by Michael Cashman, is a middle-class yuppie described as an amiable chap with a kind heart who often ends up being used by the less considerate locals. He is Walford's first on-screen gay resident and when his sexuality is eventually revealed it causes shockwaves around the Square. Colin is EastEnders' first homosexual character. Introduced in August 1986, Colin was one of the more popular characters in the early years of the programme. At first the audience and the residents of Walford were kept in the dark about the fact that Colin was gay. This changed by the end of the year, at which time Colin acquired a young boyfriend named Barry Clark (Gary Hailes). Colin was one of the most controversial characters of his time – mainly because gay-orientated content was still relatively rare on prime-time television during the mid-1980s. Gay characters that existed were usually farcical, camp parodies, created purely for comic relief, such as Mr Humphries in the situation comedy, Are You Being Served?.


== Tom Clements ==

Tom Clements, played by Donald Tandy between 1986 and 1988, is an army war veteran. Tom is first seen in Albert Square in August 1986. He lives with his spinster sister in the council house at Number 25 Albert Square and he initially works for the council as custodian of the community centre. Tom accepts an offer to work as potman at The Queen Victoria public house. He is paid in pints and occasional cash-in-hand. He has an allotment and competes with Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) in the growing of leeks and marrows. Tom's leeks are damaged by Roly the dog, which Tom initially accuses Arthur of doing. Tom then takes Arthur's leeks and enters them into the Walford & District Allotment Society Show and wins first prize. After his sister dies, Tom seeks the female company of Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement), but Dot remains faithful to her marriage vows and Pat thinks Tom is too old for her boisterous lifestyle. Later, Tom swaps lodgings with Dot and moves next door to the flat at Number 23A Albert Square. After feeling unwell, Tom stumbles into the pub toilets and dies of a heart attack on 21 April 1988. As he has no close relatives or friends surviving, Dot takes it upon herself to arrange his funeral and dispose of his personal belongings. She is named executor of his will, and is further shocked to find that Tom carried a small picture of her in his pocket. Dot asks Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to cater for the wake. She is furious when she is the only one who attends Tom's funeral.


== Dr Singh ==

Dr Jaggat Singh, played by Amerjit Deu, first arrives in Albert Square in November 1986. He is employed by Dr Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton) as a locum to cover the surgery for him several days a week.
Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh) shows a romantic interest in Jaggat and they go on several dates. Naima's cousin Rezaul Kabir (Tanveer Ghani) is furious as Jaggat is a Sikh and Naima is Muslim, and he tries to provoke Jaggat into a fight in The Queen Victoria one night. However, Jaggat just laughs off Rezaul's aggression and they eventually become friends. In the end nothing serious ever develops between Jaggat and Naima anyway, as Naima ends the relationship to marry Farrukh – a suitor from Bangladesh.
Having Lou Beale (Anna Wing), Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) as patients sharpens his interest in the elderly and Jaggat leaves the Square in December 1987 for full-time work with old people in a Northern home. Shortly before leaving, he persuades Ethel to move into sheltered housing at Prosper Estate.


== Barry Clark ==

Barry Clark, played by Gary Hailes, is a cockney barrow-boy, and an unlikely partner for the gay, middle-class yuppie, Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). He is much younger than his middle-aged boyfriend and as such Colin's role is almost paternal. Barry is open about his sexuality to everyone except his volatile father – and when he is finally told he takes the news so badly that Barry turns straight just to appease him – although he is never very successful at it. Barry is one half of Walford's first homosexual couple. His boyfriend, Colin, had already been introduced to the show several months prior to Barry's arrival and he had proven to be an extremely popular addition to the cast. Both the audience and the residents of Walford had been kept in the dark about the fact that Colin was gay. This changed upon Barry's first scene on-screen, whereby the audience learnt that he had spent the night with Colin after picking him up the night before (off-screen) at a gay club. Colin and Barry were two of the most controversial characters of their time – mainly because gay-orientated content was still relatively rare on prime time television during the mid-1980s. Gay characters that existed were usually farcical camp parodies, created purely for comic relief, such as Mr. Humphries in the situation comedy, Are You Being Served?.


== Rezaul Kabir ==

Rezaul Kabir, played by Tanveer Ghani, arrives in Albert Square in December 1986. He is Naima Jeffery's (Shreela Ghosh) cousin and had been sent by Naima's family to help her run her grocery store, First Til Last. Naima is extremely angry about Rezaul's arrival, but her family are adamant that he has to stay, so she begrudgingly puts up with his presence. Rezaul is rather bossy, pretentious, chauvinistic and arrogant, and instantly tries to take over the running of the shop. On his first night, Rezaul puts forth a scheme to increase the shop's profits and asks for a month's trial. Naima agrees to the trial. Rezaul then proceeds to mark up the shop's items to unreasonably high prices as well as steal money from the till. Naima is furious and to make matters worse it soon becomes clear that Rezaul has amorous intentions towards her.
Naima isn't remotely interested in Rezaul so she sets about finding herself a new boyfriend to put him off. She starts dating the Square's new doctor, Jaggat Singh (Amerjit Deu). Rezaul, a Muslim, becomes very envious when he sees them together and tells Naima that she is making a fool of herself, smiling and fawning over a Sikh. This culminates in Rezaul trying to pick a fight with Dr. Singh in The Queen Victoria one night, almost getting himself barred in the process.
In April 1987, Naima and Rezaul get into a shouting match when he tells her that her family have decided she has to marry him. He is furious when she flatly refuses, but later admits that he is actually relieved and tells her he doesn't want to marry her either. Naima's defiance displeases her family and they subsequently break off all ties with her. Rezaul, it seems, is rather impressed with Naima and tells her that she is no ordinary Bengali girl as he'd first thought.
Things between Naima and Rezaul improve after this, and when Naima's family eventually send over another of her cousins for her to marry, he goes out of his way to help their blossoming romance. After Naima leaves England to live in Bangladesh, Rezaul runs The First Til Last in her place for a while. Whilst managing the shop, he catches Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) shoplifting and makes a citizen's arrest. Charlie then has to appear at the Magistrates' Court and is given a £50 fine. When Naima's family sell the shop to Ashraf Karim (Aftab Sachak) at the end of the year, Rezaul leaves Walford to resume his studies. His last appearance is in January 1988.

120,"Cynthia Lee Fontaine is the stage name of Carlos Díaz Hernández, a Puerto Rican drag performer and reality television personality from Austin, Texas, best known for competing on the eighth and ninth seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race. She won the title of Miss Congeniality on season 8.


== Early life and education ==
Hernández was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico as the oldest child of Maria Hernandez. He has a degree in clinical psychology and worked in the mental health field for six years before starting drag. Hernández began doing drag in Puerto Rico in 2006, and moved to Killeen, Texas in 2008, where he started performing at Oil Can Harry's. He moved to Austin in 2011 and continued performing.


== Career ==
Fontaine competed on the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, which premiered on March 7, 2016. During the show, she frequently referred to her ""cucu"", meaning buttocks, which became a part of the show's slang. Entertainment Weekly said ""cucu"" has evolved ""into the queer pop cultural canon"". Fontaine was the third queen eliminated, garnering a 10th-place finish. Even though she was only on the show for three episodes, Fontaine was voted Miss Congeniality by the fans, giving her the distinction of being voted Miss Congeniality while having spent the least amount of time on the show compared to other award recipients.

Fontaine was invited back for RuPaul's Drag Race season 9 as the surprise 14th queen. The show premiered on March 24, 2017. In episode six, Fontaine portrayed Sofia Vergara for Snatch Game, an impersonation that was not received well by the judges. The A.V. Club wrote ""Cynthia Lee Fontaine’s Sofia Vergara is the big disaster of this ""Snatch Game,"" and even without the largely incomprehensible dialogue, it's a failure on a visual level."" Fontaine ended up securing once again the 10th-place finish, being sent home in a lipsync challenge against Peppermint. In an interview with Vulture, Fontaine said: It was probably my time, you know? I'm a fighter. I may have been a little bit concerned about the challenges and all this stuff, but I respect the panel of judges and RuPaul. I got so much from season nine, so no regrets.

The Houston Chronicle, lamenting her short run on the show in season 8, stated Fontaine was ""like a bilingual Tammie Brown"", referencing another queen from season 1 of the show. Denver Pride called her ""a fixture of the Austin drag scene"". Fontaine is a regular guest at the RuPaul's Drag Cons. She appeared at RuPaul's DragCon LA 2016 and 2017, and at RuPaul's DragCon NYC in 2017 and 2019.
In November 2017, Fontaine participated in Queens United/Reinas Unidas, a benefit show organized by Phi Phi O'Hara in support of Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. The show raised over $80,000. Fontaine stated, ""Puerto Rico, you are part of our heart in the United States of America. I'm Puerto Rican. I love you from the bottom of my heart, and you've got our support."" In September 2018, Fontaine became the third drag queen ever hosted at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Previous drag queens performed there in 2012 and 2015. The event, hosted by the Latin American Student Organization, included a performance and interview, which ""touched on themes of family, health and getting out of one's comfort zone."" On her YouTube channel, Fontaine has two shows: CuCu Confessions and Memoirs of My CuCu. She also headlines a one-woman show called Cynthia Lee Fontaine: More Intimate CuCu Confessions, which she performs around the United States.


=== Music ===
Fontaine released her first single ""Pegajosa"" in November 2018.  Writing for World of Wonder, James St. James called the song ""fabulous"" and the accompanying music video ""ultra-fabuloso"".


== Personal life and recognition ==
Fontaine was diagnosed with stage 1 liver cancer in 2015, two weeks after filming the third episode of the eighth season of Drag Race. He stated during the filming of the show he lost 47 pounds. After four rounds of chemotherapy, he went into remission. He also revealed on the show that he almost performed at Pulse nightclub the night of the Orlando shooting in 2016. He stated, ""we never expect that a tragedy like this would happen in our community. We thought we'd finally built a safe space.""
The City of Austin was set to proclaim March 26, 2020, as Cynthia Lee Fontaine Day, but had to postpone because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas.

127,"Lil Miss Hot Mess (born c. 1984) is an American drag queen, activist, and children’s book author, known for her work with the #MyNameIs campaign and Drag Queen Story Hour.


== Early life and career ==
Lil Miss Hot Mess was raised Reform Jewish and had a Bar Mitzvah. She began performing in San Francisco in 2008 at The Stud.  In 2010, at the age of 26, she threw herself a ""Bat Mitzvah x2"" and later that year won the inaugural title of Tiara Sensation, hosted by Club Some Thing.
In 2014, Lil Miss Hot Mess co-founded the #MyNameIs campaign alongside other drag performers (including as Sister Roma and Alex U. Inn), as well as LGBTQ and BIPOC activists, sexual violence survivors, and privacy advocates to protest Facebook’s real-name policy.  The group met with and protested Facebook leadership, claiming that the platform prevented users from being their authentic selves and maintaining their privacy.  In a piece for Salon, Lil Miss Hot Mess wrote:

Facebook imagines itself as a community, but its names policy fails to acknowledge how diverse people experience their everyday lives ... And for many of us who are already on the margins, being able to make these virtual connections—outside regular social structures and where we live—can deeply change our lives ...  And if we want a space to be truly authentic accountable to one another, it’s our responsibility to demand that Facebook be accountable to us as well.
In 2017, Lil Miss Hot Mess appeared on Saturday Night Live as a backup dancer for Katy Perry, with a group of drag and ballroom performers including Indya Moore, Brita Filter, Scarlet Envy, and Vivacious.
Lil Miss Hot Mess also appeared in a 2020 Biden-Harris campaign video to the tune of ""America the Beautiful.""
Outside of her drag career, Lil Miss Hot Mess is a university professor, and she holds a PhD from NYU.  She has published in academic journals on subjects like “drag pedagogy” and digital drag performance.


=== Drag Queen Story Hour ===
In 2016, Lil Miss Hot Mess became involved for Drag Queen Story Hour as one of the first queens to read for the group in New York City.  She has since performed Drag Queen Story Hour readings at venues like the Brooklyn Public Library, Institute for Contemporary Arts Los Angeles, and HBO’s Human By Orientation digital platform.
In 2020, she published a children’s book called The Hips on the Drag Queen Go Swish, Swish, Swish, illustrated by Olga de Dios and published by Running Press Kids.  The book received positive reviews, including Kirkus Reviews, which described it as “a fun, movement-filled, family-friendly celebration of drag.”  In an interview, Lil Miss Hot Mess described her goal behind writing the book as:

The book grew out of my work with Drag Queen Story Hour ... There’s no “Drag 101,” but it gets them swishing and shimmying and twirling, so they can embody and celebrate some of the things queens do.
The Hips on the Drag Queen Go Swish, Swish, Swish was also featured as a favorite by Jesse Tyler Ferguson on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, as a book he likes to read to his son.
In 2021, Lil Miss Hot Mess read The Hips on the Drag Queen Go Swish, Swish, Swish in a segment of the television show Let’s Learn, produced by New York City PBS affiliate WNET and the New York City Department of Education.  The segment stirred controversy among right-wing groups that frequently target Drag Queen Story Hour, and who took issue with her suggestion that “I think we might have some drag queens in training on our hands.”  PBS eventually took down the segment from its main website, however it is available on the local affiliate’s YouTube channel.
In May 2022, as Drag Queen Story Hour came under increased attacks from conservatives, Senator Marco Rubio specifically criticized Lil Miss Hot Mess’s Hips book referring to it as “sexually charged content.” In response, Lil Miss Hot Mess was outspoken in defending her work, describing these and similar remarks as “an attack not only on freedom of expression but on imagination,” and writing that, “if there is anything that drag performers and kids can learn from each other, it is to get in touch with one’s inner curiosity, conscience and creativity.”
Also in May 2022, Lil Miss Hot Mess published her second children’s book If You’re a Drag Queen and You Know It.
In April 2024, Lil Miss Hot Mess led a Queer Storytime for Palestine in Northampton, Massachusetts, and instructed the children to chant ""Free Palestine"", dress in Palestinian attire and waive the Palestinian flag and the transgender flag. Organizations such as StopAntisemitism raised concerns of indoctrination.

All characters are introduced by the show's senior executive producer, Kate Oates, executive producer, Jon Sen, or his successor, Chris Clenshaw. The first character to be introduced is Nina Gupta (Hersha Verity) in February, who was introduced as the new GP. Lewis Butler (Aidan O'Callaghan), a man that Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) hires as the manager of her bar, was introduced in April, and Omar Lye-Fook debuted in July as Avery Baker, the brother of established character Mitch Baker (Roger Griffiths).

On being cast on the soap, she said: ""There is nothing like this kind of experience, it's so iconic. Just a part of British culture, so it's exciting, but that can be quite nerve-wracking! When I was walking through the corridors and saw the pictures on the wall, I felt a real sense of history. It just felt like I was part of something very special. You are stepping into history. It is a really nice place to experience being an actor."" Verity's father would not allow her to watch EastEnders as a child so she found it amusing to be cast on the soap. Walking onto the set for the first time was an exciting experience for her due to being early in her acting career; it led her to ""just take a moment and [be] so grateful to have this experience"".

It’s interesting what Peggy says about him – that she’s not too fond of that branch of the family. He seems to have a better relationship with his cousin Eric, they are like partners in crime. I see him as a very selfish character, a product of his era."". He added: ""He’s not a good father, we know that he put both his kids in a home. I don’t know if he carries any guilt about that, I did try to bear that in mind. I put a lot of thought into him.

== Early life ==
Shane Gilberto Jenek was born in Brisbane, Australia, and moved to Sydney at age 18. He was born to Gill and Annette Jenek and has an older sister named Kim. His mother is of Danish descent and his father is of German descent; they worked in Kings Cross and befriended cabaret performer and TV personality Carlotta. Growing up, Jenek would always dress up and sing and dance, but couldn't identify with anything that was portrayed in the media. In 1987, he entered a competition, Tiny Tots, which was a charity pageant show for children, and won. At a young age, Jenek began attending The Fame Talent School where he became close friends with twins Lisa Origliasso and Jessica Origliasso, who would later become The Veronicas. The group would perform together for twelve years, performing acts such as pantomime in local shopping centres such as the Strathpine Centre, the Toombul Shopping Centre, and Westfield Chermside. Jenek found school difficult due to bullying over his sexuality. He began to think something was wrong with him during his teenage years. He attended Nashville Primary School in Brighton, but his parents wanted him to go to a private school for his secondary studies, so he transferred to St Paul's Anglican School in Bald Hills a year early to ""acclimatise"". Jenek disliked the school, and moved to Sandgate District State High School after two years at St. Paul's. After school, he would frequently go clubbing with friends in Brisbane, particularly on Mary Street. Jenek received high grades at school and he was going to study medicine to become a doctor instead of an entertainer. He first attended the Stonewall Club in the mid-90s and Jenek states that was the start of his ""big queer life"". While touring colleges, he visited the National Institute of Dramatic Art, and, instead of moving forward to Perth to tour the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, he spent a week in Sydney behind his parents’ backs ""living a lifetime of gay"".


== Career ==


=== Beginnings and Australian Idol ===
Jenek's drag queen career began in 2002 when he met Sydney drag queen Vanity Faire. He was intrigued by the visual feminine illusion Faire would create once she was in drag and this inspired him to begin his drag career. While deciding his drag name, he originally intended to take the name ""Ginger Le'Bon"" and be a ""redheaded, smoky voiced nightclub singer"", but, instead, he decided upon the stage name Courtney Act as, in a non-rhotic accent like the Australian accent, the phrase ""caught in the act"" is heard. Courtney has stated that in 2002, when she began performing in drag, one had to ""fight"" and ""earn"" one's place as a drag queen. She entered the Diva Rising Star competition in 2002 and won.
In 2003, while working as a waiter at Jimmy's on the Mall, a restaurant in Brisbane, Courtney auditioned for the inaugural season of Australian Idol. He first appeared as Jenek, but the judges, Ian Dickson, Marcia Hines and Mark Holden, told Jenek that his voice was ""just not up to it"". The following day, Jenek returned to audition but as Courtney Act. Hines said that Courtney was ""great"". Dickson said, ""Shane only didn't just cut it. You've added another dimension and this time you've blown us away."" Courtney continued through the competition and reached the live finals. In the first TV vote Courtney did not advance; however, the judges brought her back as a wildcard. During her time on the show she performed songs such as: ""I Am Woman"" by Helen Reddy, ""You Don't Own Me"" by Lesley Gore and “You Shook Me All Night Long"" by AC/DC. Courtney finished in thirteenth place on the show, but remained highly popular throughout Australia. At the time, Jenek was the first and only LGBT contestant to openly appear on a reality TV talent show.

131,"The Crystal Method is an American electronic music act formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, by Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland in the early 1990s. They were pioneers of the big beat genre and their music has appeared in numerous TV shows, films, video games, and advertisements. Their 1997 debut studio album Vegas was certified platinum in 2007, and saw follow-ups Tweekend, Legion of Boom, Divided by Night, and The Crystal Method. In 2017, Ken Jordan retired from music and left the group, with Scott Kirkland adopting The Crystal Method as a solo moniker.


== History ==

The Crystal Method originally had two members, Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland. Before The Crystal Method was formed, Jordan and Kirkland started working on music while working at a grocery store. Jordan was also a local DJ in Las Vegas as well as the college radio program director at UNLV. Jordan taught Kirkland how to DJ, and when Jordan moved to Los Angeles to work for a producer, Kirkland took over his job DJing at the local club. Kirkland also moved out to Los Angeles, and they formed The Crystal Method in 1993.
While working as a production duo for a rapper, a person named Crystal would handle transportation needs. The rapper repeatedly referred to her method of transportation as ""The Crystal Method."" The pair adopted the name based on the layout of the three words and the sound of the name.


=== Early days (1993–1995) ===
By the early 1990s, both Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland had moved from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Jordan and Kirkland rented a house together, in La Crescenta, Glendale, California, which had a small underground shelter beneath the front lawn. Originally intending to turn the shelter into a studio, it proved to be an unrealistic idea and the duo set up a studio in their house which was located near a 210 Freeway overpass. They subsequently named their studio The Bomb Shelter. They were interviewed on the front lawn of the house in the documentary Better Living Through Circuitry.
After The Bomb Shelter was built, a tape of The Crystal Method's music found its way to British DJ Justin King. King was interested in starting a record label that would showcase American electronic dance acts. Together with Steve Melrose, King formed the record label City of Angels Record Label. The first official release from the City of Angels label was The Crystal Method's ""Now is the Time"". The Crystal Method were signed to Outpost Recordings in 1996.


=== Vegas (1996–1998) ===
After the band signed with Outpost, they began working on their debut album. The group's final single on the City of Angels Record Label was ""Keep Hope Alive"". Their next single was ""Come2gether"", from the Mortal Kombat: More Kombat soundtrack.
On September 8, 1997, The Crystal Method released their debut studio album, Vegas. Vegas peaked at number 92 on the Billboard 200. It was certified gold by the RIAA in 1998, then platinum in 2007.
The album's release was supported by its four singles (""Keep Hope Alive"", ""Trip Like I Do"", ""Busy Child"", and ""Comin' Back"") and by the inclusion of eight of its tracks on the soundtrack for the video game N2O. The game's publisher, Fox Interactive, sponsored The Crystal Method's 1998 tour. Jordan said that in live performances, ""We definitely go for intensity. We're not interested in making our shows look like reality. We're interested in making the most intense and dynamic experience you've ever been through.""
A reworking of ""Trip Like I Do"", called ""(Can't You) Trip Like I Do"", was also included as a collaborative effort with Filter on soundtrack to the film adaptation of Spawn in 1997 and on the soundtrack of Michael Benveniste's Tedd Can chronicles.


=== Tweekend (1999–2002) ===
In 1999, the band recorded their second studio album, Tweekend, which featured more guest artists than Vegas. The album was released in July 2001, and peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200, which remains the group's highest album chart position to date.
Featured guests from the album include Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, Stone Temple Pilots vocalist Scott Weiland, and others, like Doug Grean, DJ Swamp, Ryan ""Ryu"" Maginn, and Julie Gallios. Four singles were released from Tweekend: ""Wild, Sweet and Cool"", ""Murder"", ""Blowout"", ""Name of the Game"".
Jordan and Kirkland formerly ran a radio show called Community Service which aired Friday nights on radio station Indie 103.1, in California. They played music and hosted guests including Death in Vegas and Unkle.
A year after the release of Tweekend, The Crystal Method released a continuous mix album based on their radio show, titled Community Service. The album does not feature any new studio material from The Crystal Method, but is composed of remixes of bands like P.O.D., Rage Against the Machine, and Garbage, plus remixes of songs from Tweekend. Their remix of P.O.D.'s ""Boom"" from this album, also appeared in the video game Amplitude.
Community Service peaked at number 160 on the Billboard 200, number five on the Top Electronic Albums chart, and number 15 on the Top Independent Albums chart.


=== Legion of Boom (2003–2005) ===

After the release of Community Service, The Crystal Method went back into the studio to record their third album, Legion of Boom. During the recording, they used the house as their recording studio instead of The Bomb Shelter.
In December 2003, the single ""Born Too Slow"", with vocals from John Garcia and guitar by Wes Borland was released. Legion of Boom was released on January 13, 2004, and peaked at number 36 on the Billboard 200. It sold over 25,000 copies in its first week. The track was also part of the soundtrack of the 2003 video game Need for Speed: Underground, used prominently in its demo.
The other single released from Legion of Boom, ""Starting Over"", featured vocals from Rahzel. No other singles were released but other songs, including ""Weapons of Mass Distortion"", ""Bound Too Long"" and ""Realizer"", appeared in various movies and TV shows. ""I Know It's You"" appeared in the trailer for the film Resident Evil: Extinction, and includes vocals from Milla Jovovich.
In 2005, the album was nominated for the Best Electronic/Dance Album Grammy, the first year that category existed. It lost to Kish Kash by Basement Jaxx.
Around this time, Jordan and Kirkland formed their own record label, called Tiny E Records. Also in 2005, Jordan and Kirkland composed an original theme for the TV series Bones, which remained in use for seven seasons before Jordan and Kirkland remixed the theme which has been in use since the beginning of season 8.
In 2004, The Crystal Method collaborated with Alan Parsons, on his fourth solo album since the demise of the Alan Parsons Project, A Valid Path, on the song ""We Play The Game"".
On April 5, 2005, The Crystal Method released their sequel to Community Service, titled Community Service II, another continuous mix of electronica songs and remixes of music by artists including The Doors, Unkle, New Order and Smashing Pumpkins. The album peaked at number 31 on the Top Independent Albums chart and number 8 on the Top Electronic albums chart.
A 5 track EP, Community Service II Exclusives, was released through the iTunes Store. It included one new track, ""Badass"", and full versions of four tracks from Community Service II. It was removed from the iTunes store not long after it was released.


=== Drive, London, and Vegas re-release (2006–2008) ===

The group composed and performed the score for the film London, which was released in February 2006. The soundtrack album included excerpts from the score, two Crystal Method vocal tracks—""Smoked"" and ""Glass Breaker"", which were also released as a single—and songs by artists like Evil Nine, The Out Crowd, and The Perishers.
Shortly after the release of the London soundtrack, The Crystal Method was approached by Nike to take part in a series of music releases specifically designed to be listened to while running. The group's contribution, Drive: Nike + Original Run—the first in the series—was initially released digitally, in June 2006, with the physical release following a year later. Drive peaked at number 23 on the Top Electronic Albums chart. The album, a 45-minute continuous mix, starts off slow, increases in tempo, and slows at the end, following the arc of a typical distance run. In 2006 the track ""Robogirl"" released by the duo appeared on Dance Dance Revolution: SuperNOVA.
In 2007, ten years after its original release, the group's debut album, Vegas was certified platinum by the RIAA. One month later, a special edition of the album was released, with a second disc including remixes and video.
In late 2008, the group remixed their song ""Now Is the Time"". Where the original version featured samples of Jesse Jackson, this ""Vote '08 Remix"" used samples of Barack Obama, marking the presidential election.


=== Divided by Night (2009–2012) ===

Following the release of Legion of Boom, The Crystal Method began construction of a new, full-sized recording studio in Los Angeles—Crystalwerks. When it was finished, they began work on their fourth studio album, Divided by Night.
On April 14, 2009, The Crystal Method released the digital single ""Drown in the Now"". A second single, ""Black Rainbows"", was released via Beatport two weeks later.
The Divided by Night tour started in Boston on May 6, and the album was released the following week. It peaked at number 38 on the Billboard 200, number two on the Top Electronic Albums chart, and number four on the Top Independent Albums chart, and also granted the duo another Grammy nomination. The album features guest artists including LMFAO, Peter Hook (of New Order), Matisyahu, Meiko, Justin Warfield, Emily Haines (of Metric), and Jason Lytle.
X Games 3D: The Movie, released in August 2009, included a number of Crystal Method songs and remixes, including ""Drown in the Now"" and ""Now Is the Time"".


=== The Crystal Method and Ken Jordan's departure (2013–2017) ===
Originally scheduled for a June, 2013, release, their eponymous fifth studio album The Crystal Method was delayed by a surgery to remove a cyst in Scott Kirkland's brain. The album was released on January 14, 2014.
When approximately halfway creating the next album process, Scott Kirkland received news that he had developed ""what's called a benign posterior fossa arachnoid cyst that needed to be removed from my head."" He explains, ""It's a simple procedure as far as brain surgery goes, but they still had to cut into my skull and noodle around in there. The surgery wasn't as bad as the infection afterwards, which landed me in the ICU for ten days. Thankfully, I made it out okay. In hindsight, as weird as it sounds, I think we were able to make a better record because we came through this."" Following his 2013 recovery, Scott regrouped with Ken Jordan and continued working on the album.
In late 2013, the duo were asked to compose the score and opening theme of Almost Human, a science fiction crime drama airing on Fox. The same year, two of the Crystal Method's songs, ""Play for Real"" and ""Over It"", were featured in the 2013 racing game Asphalt 8: Airborne.
In 2014, TCM's song ""Single Barrel (Sling the Decks)"" was featured in the film Lucy.
In early 2017, Ken Jordan decided to retire from music, and left The Crystal Method, however Scott Kirkland continues to produce and play shows under the moniker as a solo project.
In 2017, Scott as The Crystal Method went on tour with Tool, and collaborated with Tool bass player Justin Chancellor on a side project called Bandwidth.


=== The Trip Home (2018) ===

On July 20, 2018, Kirkland announced a North American tour to support the new album.
On September 7, 2018, Kirkland announced the second single ""There's a Difference"" featuring Franky Perez, which released the same day.
On November 26, 2018, Kirkland and Jean-Michel Jarre announced that they would be collaborating on a track on Jean-Michel Jarre's next electronica album.


=== The Trip Out (2022) ===
On February 18, 2022, The Crystal Method announced a follow-up album to The Trip Home titled The Trip Out while simultaneously releasing their first single ""Post Punk"" featuring DJ Hyper and Iggy Pop.

Montrese became interested in drag around age 19 or 20 and was named by her drag mother Mokha Montrese. She entered pageantry, eventually becoming runner up in the 2010 Miss Gay America pageant. The titleholder, Alyssa Edwards, was stripped of her crown for conflicting business dealings. On February 27, 2010, Montrese was then crowned as Miss Gay America 2010.
Before appearing on RuPaul's Drag Race, Montrese worked at Walt Disney World for 11 years as an entertainer for the Fantasmic show. Working there allowed her to be able to work during the day and do drag during the evenings. She then moved to Las Vegas, where she appeared in a number of shows as a Janet Jackson impersonator.
Montrese applied just once for RuPaul's Drag Race and was accepted for their fifth season as one of fourteen contestants. The series aired during January–May 6, 2013.

When asked if queer people should support the Black Lives Matter movement, Montrese responded, ""I think it’s important the LGBTQ community support all movements that support all people and equality for all. If we don’t start shedding light on these things, younger generations won’t even recognize it. If you don’t bring up the past, you are doomed to repeat it. We’re all fighting for the same thing — they want to be seen as the same as everyone else — so yes, they should support that. ""

=== Season 5 ===

In 2012, It was announced that Montrese had been cast on the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Where she was cast alongside Alyssa Edwards, who she had fallen out with over Edwards being unable to complete her run as Miss Gay America 2010 due to breaking contractual duties and being replaced by Montrese. The two's history lead to many arguments and dramatic moments throughout the season. After a poor showing in a children's show-themed acting challenge in the third episode, Montrese fell into the bottom two alongside Monica Beverly Hillz, where the two would lip sync to The Pussycat Dolls's When I Grow Up which Montrese wins, eliminating Beverly Hillz. In episode 6, Montrese would be in the bottom two for a second time, this time against Jade Jolie, who Montrese had formed a friendship with in the competition. Montrese won the lip sync to I'm So Excited by The Pointer Sisters and stayed in the competition. In the following episode Coco won her first and only main challenge in a roast where she was praised by the judges for her entire performance and her look. In the ninth episode, Montrese and Alyssa Edwards would do badly in a Telenovela challenge and fell in the bottom two together, and after a close lip sync to Paula Abdul's Cold Hearted, Montrese emerged victorious from the feud and Edwards was sent home. Montrese's success wouldn't last long however as in the following episode she would land in the bottom for her fourth time and lip synced against Detox to Two to Make It Right by Seduction and lost the lip sync, finishing in fifth place.


=== All Stars 2 ===

In 2016 it was announced that Coco Montrese had been cast on the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. The cast included four other queens from season 5, including her season 5 nemesis, Alyssa Edwards. However, upon Montrese's entrance, it is revealed that the pair had since forgiven each other. A weak performance in the talent show meant that Montrese was up for elimination in the first episode, but remained confident that her fellow season 5 queen, Roxxxy Andrews would not eliminate her; however, Andrews chose to save Phi Phi O'Hara and Adore Delano, eliminating Montrese first.
In episode 5, a twist was incorporated which allowed eliminated queens to potentially return to the game, the challenge being to pair up with a queen who is still in the game and perform a standup comedy routine. Montrese and partner Phi Phi O'Hara would perform badly meaning Montrese was not eligible to return. Montrese finished in 10th place in All Stars 2.

Garcia's singing career began when he was 7 years old, as a member of children's musical group Turma do Balão Mágico. During his childhood, Groove starred in the RecordTV telenovela Savage, and began work as a voice actor. After a period working in theatre as a teenager, Garcia adopted the drag persona ""Gloria Groove"" in 2014. Two years later, he started gaining prominence by appearing in the TV Globo reality show Amor & Sexo.
Gloria Groove's singing career launched with the release of the single ""Dona"" in January 2016. After its success, Groove released ""Império"", and was featured in Carnival hit ""Catuaba"" by Aretuza Lovi. Groove's first album, O Proceder, was released in February 2017 and was followed by the singles ""Gloriosa"" and ""Muleke Brasileiro"". At the end of 2017, Groove released one of the most successful singles of her career, ""Bumbum de Ouro"".

== Biography ==


=== 1995–2016: Early life and career ===
Daniel Garcia Felicione Napoleão was born on January 18, 1995, in São Paulo, to a family of artists. Daniel grew up in the Vila Formosa neighborhood, where he accompanied his mother, Gina Garcia, during her shows. Daniel's mother was a backing vocal for pagode group Raça Negra, while his aunt was also a singer and his maternal grandparents were circus performers. Inspired by his mother, Daniel recalls singing since he was 4. When he was 6, he starred in advertisements for Elma Chips (Brazilian counterpart to Lay's). He then auditioned in the program Domingo Legal, when he was 7, to become part of the band Turma do Balão Mágico (known as ""Galera do Balão"" at the time); he was a member of the musical act between 7 and 9 years. After performing in Programa Raul Gil as part of a children's gospel group, the ten-year-old Daniel competed at the talent show host by the program. He only competed for two weeks because he was selected to star in the Rede Record telenovela Bicho do Mato (2006–2007). Daniel started his career as a voice actor in this period; one of the major roles was to dub Rico Suave in Hannah Montana.
Daniel grew up feeling he was different and was bullied in school. He also attended the Protestant church Reborn in Christ through his childhood until his teenage years and in the church, he learned about soul music and black music. He gradually stopped going to church as he started working in theatre at the age of 14 and came out as gay. During this time, he played the role of Margaret Mead in an independent stage performance of Hair. Inspired by the play's themes, he decided to create a drag queen persona. The theatre made him appreciate the possibility of mixing music, performance, dance, makeup and costume. Watching RuPaul's Drag Race, he concluded he could do his performances not only in the theatre, but also on clubs and shows. At 17–18, he adopted the stage name ""Gloria Groove"", chosen after how hymns are called in Brazilian Protestant churches and the musical term of the same name associated with black music.
Groove worked as ""coach"" in ""Bishow"", a segment in the TV Globo program Amor e Sexo in which contestants competed as drag queens. Although the filming lasted until November 2015, the show was only broadcast between January and February 2016.


=== 2016–present: debut as a singer and first album ===
Gloria Groove started a career as a singer by releasing the single ""Dona"" in January 2016 through the label SB Music. It was followed by the song's music video directed by João Monteiro in March; it was a hit, being watched 1.7 million times in a year. In August, Groove released the single, ""Império"", whose music video was released in October and was also directed by Monteiro. In November, Groove was featured in Aretuza Lovi's single ""Catuaba"", which was a moderate success in Brazilian Carnival. First announced as an extended play to be released in March 2016, Groove released the eight-track album O Proceder in February 2017. To promote the album, Groove announced the release of single versions for ""Gloriosa"" and ""Muleke Brasileiro"". The former's music video was released in June, and it was released along with ""Dona"" and ""Império"" in a mash-up version by ONErpm in November. The latter's music video, directed by Rafael Kent, was released in November, while its single version was published by SB Music in December. Groove was also among the singers chosen to perform ""Filhos do Arco-Íris"", a single released in June 2017 whose profit was destined to amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.
Since November 2017, Groove is producing a second album. In December 2017, Groove released the first single for the upcoming album, ""Bumbum de Ouro"", one of the singer's most successful songs and a hit during Carnival. It gained more popularity when the music video directed by Os Primos was released in February 2018; it reached the top of Spotify Brazil's viral chart, and the video was watched over 5 million times on YouTube in three weeks. In January 2018, Groove was featured on Aretuza Lovi's single ""Joga Bunda"" along with Pabllo Vittar; its music video directed by Felipe Sassi got more than 10 million views on YouTube in a month. In May 2018, Groove released ""Arrasta"", produced by Os Catioros and featuring axé singer Léo Santana. As a fan, Groove was the one who decided to invite Santana and hoped the partnership would help to reach a wider public. The music video for ""Arrasta"" was directed by Sassi and was released in June. In the same month, Groove was featured in a remix version of ""Show das Poderosas"", released by Anitta as part of a Warner Music campaign for the LGBT Pride Month.
Groove's next single, ""Apaga a Luz"", was released in September 2018 and its music video directed by Sassi was made available in October. A romantic R&B song, it was turned into a commentary on abusive relationships by Sassi. In November, the singer was featured in Lexa's single and music video ""Provocar"". In January, Groove released the single ""Coisa Boa"", produced by Pablo Bispo, Sergio Santos and Ruxell. Inspired by Brazilian political context with the election of Jair Bolsonaro, a music video was filmed in a defunct prison after a suggestion by director Sassi. The video was influenced by Lady Gaga's ""Telephone"" and Orange Is the New Black and was watched by over a million and a half viewers in two days.


== Artistry and public image ==
Daniel defines the ""Gloria Groove"" persona as ""half drag, half rapper"", and Groove's compositions vary from soul, trap, R&B, and Brazilian funk. The singer is also known for performing and singing both as ""male rapper"" and a ""female queer""; for example, the singer does this in the music videos for ""Dona"", ""Império"", ""Bumbum de Ouro"", and ""Apaga a Luz"". As a ""queer, effeminate, a non-white drag queen."", Groove's career as a singer is a way to ""use my own voice to point out what's wrong [in Brazil]"". Since the first song, ""Dona"", Groove showed this feature with sarcastic lines such as ""Oh My Lord / What animal is that? / Nice to meet you, my name is art, darling"". The singer aims to represent the LGBT community: ""My music hopes to signify the existence of thousands of LGBTIQ people—our music becomes a platform of love and self-acceptance.""
Groove was influenced by hip hop since during the childhood; the singer appreciated male rappers, such as Usher, but the main inspiration to sing comes from female rappers, including Lil' Kim, Missy Elliott, Nicki Minaj, Karol Conká, and Flora Matos. At first, Groove did not intend to be labeled as a ""drag rapper"", but later thought it could be something that differentiates the singer's work. While O Proceder was considered to be mostly a rap work, it already included songs that mix rap and pop as ""Muleke Brasileiro"", also said to be a ""Reggaeton-like song"". The following song, ""Bumbum de Ouro"", was deemed entirely pop with a funk inspiration. The singer did it consciously, hoping to achieve a wider public and it was meant to be the kickoff for the release of a pop-focused album.
Groove has been described as LGBT ""idol"" by Brazilian media. The singer was featured in ""Rain Power"", a photo essay published in the August 2017 issue of the Brazilian edition of Vogue magazine. Despite this label, Groove's songs have also been popular among the non-LGBT public. Gloria identifies as non-binary.

143,"Miss Coco Peru (born August 27, 1965) is the drag persona of American actor, comedian and drag performer Clinton Leupp, known for her role in the 1999 independent film Trick and for her series of live theater performances. Recognizable by her ""trademark copper-toned flip hairdo"", Peru also starred in Richard Day's Girls Will Be Girls (2003) and was one of six performers featured in the Logo original stand-up comedy series Wisecrack (2005). She has also appeared in a number of other supporting and guest-starring roles in film and television.
For 30 years, Peru has starred in various ""one-woman shows"" across the US and other countries, and hosted LGBT events. Since 2005, Peru has appeared in the ""Conversations with Coco"" series in which she ""interviews and celebrates the lives and careers of the LGBT community's favorite icons."" Peru's guests have included Bea Arthur, Liza Minnelli, Lesley Ann Warren, Karen Black, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda.


== Early life and the creation of Coco ==

Leupp is a native of City Island, New York. He is a 1983 graduate of Cardinal Spellman High School and studied theatre at Adelphi University. Calling himself ""a gay guy who was never going to be passing for straight"", he said that he had just started college when homophobic slurs were directed at him. ""Here we go again, I thought; I was so used to it, in high school. But by the end of those four years, I had become very popular, by just being myself, and being relatable.""
Leupp calls Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Bette Midler some of his early idols. In a 2012 interview he said, ""When I was younger, I looked up to people who were like Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin, people who created characters and got discovered that way. I always knew early on that I was gay and I wanted to be an openly gay performer. Back when I started, that was pretty rare. I was trained in the theater and I went to college for theater, and I decided to do drag as a way to express myself both in theater and as an activist. I always find that people who are able to do all of that an inspiration. I feel like Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler, early on, did that. ... [Midler] started in the bathhouses and gay men wrote her material. Of course she had the performance style to pull it off, but she also had gay men writing for her. That's why her voice had that gay sensibility."" He decided ""it was probably best for me to be openly gay on stage, and create my own character. I did a one-person show early on as myself ... All my friends came, and loved it; I was always considered funny. But I knew it wasn't going to be enough."" Leupp recalled thinking, ""How do I change people's minds, those who might not have a clear picture of who gay people were?"" He said, ""Coco came about at a time in my life when I didn't have much direction ... I realized I had to do something that made me unique ... I read a book about Native Americans 'two spirits,' which were men who dressed as women or partially as women who were often seen as the shaman or the storytellers in their communities."" ""Wouldn't it be great if I did something in drag, I decided, where people perceive you as a drag queen in a way, but as I tell the story — my story — they would forget I'm a drag queen and just relate to the story. This is what I had in mind when I started writing my first drag show.""
""So I put all those things together: I'm a drag queen/two spirit/gay activist/entertainer. And everything fell into place. It was really a magical time in my life,"" Leupp said. To find Coco's signature hairdo, he tried blonde and black wigs but thought they looked terrible; when he tried red, Leupp said ""that's the color."" ""My first hairdo was very Tina Louise/Gilligan's Island — very big. It evolved into the straight with flip going under, then I tried it with the flip going out — and I said, 'That's Coco.' Other drag queens have chided me for not changing my hairdo, but I just feel it is so much part of the persona and so recognizable, I don't want to change it."" Leupp said his parents were very supportive, ""But when I did do drag for the first time I had already done a one-person show about being gay. When I did that they were terrified — they thought I was going to have things thrown at me. But when I got applause, they realized there's a big world out there that they didn't know about. So when I decided to do drag, they were nervous, but hid it. And I think they were happy that I was received with such love when they expected me to be greeted with tomatoes.""
Leupp later ""realized the potential of drag as full-blown theater"" through the work of playwright and drag performer Charles Busch.


== Career ==

Leupp's first one-person show was Miss Coco Peru in My Goddamn Cabaret in 1992. Several more Coco Peru shows followed, as well as a 1994 guest role on New York Undercover and appearances in both Wigstock: The Movie and To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar in 1995. Peru next had a role in the 1997 romantic comedy Nick and Jane. Her follow-up was the 1999 independent film Trick. According to Peru, Trick director Jim Fall was a friend and fan, and five years before the film was shot she helped him audition actors by reading the role which ultimately went to Tori Spelling. Peru's role in the film was added specifically for her: ""They wrote me a part, which I rewrote using my own experiences. I wrote that line 'It burns.' Most of the part was written by me, which is why I played it so well.""
Peru later starred in Richard Day's Girls Will Be Girls (2003) and was one of six performers featured in the Logo original stand-up comedy series Wisecrack (2005). She has appeared in a number of other supporting and guest-starring roles in television and film, including Will & Grace in 2001 and again in 2018 and 2019, Arrested Development in 2005 and Twins in 2006; the Bravo reality series Boy Meets Boy (2003) and Welcome to the Parker (2007); the police procedural drama series Detroit 1-8-7 in 2011; the 2004 comedy film Straight-Jacket; and a 2007–2008 web series follow-up to Girls Will Be Girls. Peru performed the voice of ""Mama Hippo"" in the 2006 Disney animated feature The Wild, and later was the voice of Mother Morally Superior in a 2008 episode of the Logo stop motion animated series Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World. In 2004 Peru appeared in an Orbitz TV commercial that was later nominated for a GLAAD Media Award.

In 2008 Leupp said, ""I'm not impersonating a woman. It's just an extension of me. I'm telling autobiographical stories, and Coco gives me the freedom to be a little more outrageous and say things I wouldn't say in everyday life ... Drag allows me to embrace a lot of the things I hated about myself growing up ... Having been called a girl-boy and all that, drag is a way of saying, I'm going to embrace everything that anybody said about me, and put it out there on stage. People have said I shouldn't call myself a drag queen, that I do a disservice to myself. My reaction is I'm proud to be what I am. When I see video footage of Stonewall, I am proud to be a part of that history. I'm not saying that I am historical, but just being out there doing the drag, on television, in movies ... I have young nephews ... who know Coco, and who think it's great that I dress up as a girl. In this way, I am changing the world.""


== Personal life ==
Leupp knew he was gay at an early age. He met his husband Rafael Arias, a college professor originally from Spain, around 1995. In 2006, they married in Spain, where same-sex marriage was legal at a time before it was in the United States.
Leupp identifies as Episcopalian.


== Activism ==
Leupp stated in an October 2012 interview that as a young gay man he ""decided to do drag as a way to express myself both in theater and as an activist."" ""With friends who were sick, and dying of HIV/AIDS,"" he said in 2008, ""I wanted to be an activist as well as an entertainer.""
In a 2008 interview, Leupp said that when Showtime passed on the Girls Will Be Girls concept as a situation comedy, it was instead produced as a film ""hoping that the new gay networks would be interested."" They were not, about which Leupp commented, ""I think that drag is scary, even in our own community. They would rather play it safe. People want to be really politically correct, which I think is very dangerous. I've heard from various people in the business that these stations are appealing to Middle America, and I find that very disturbing because I always felt that we as gay people were the leaders — we decided what was funny, what was hot in fashion. Now we are trying to figure out what Middle America accepts. I'm not interested in that. I'm not trying to appeal to Middle America, and that gay people are doing so only makes me angry.""
When asked what he was most proud of among Peru's many awards and recognitions, Leupp as Peru said in 2010, ""I love when I get feedback from young gay people who tell me that my show or appearances on Logo helped them in a positive way to deal with their own identity. Recently, a young guy came up to me in Provincetown after my show and said, 'I love your anger. We're not angry enough and you inspired me.' I was in heaven!""
In November 2013, Leupp made headlines when he publicly protested the booking of a retired priest involved in reparative therapy to speak at Leupp's former high school, Cardinal Spellman Catholic in the Bronx. According to the school, Father Donald Timone would speak to parents about Catholic groups intended to convince children ""struggling with same-sex attraction"" to live ""chaste lives through participation in support groups."" Leupp said of the programs, ""It makes it look like it's a support group, but once you really see what they are doing it's disturbing ... They are trying to shame these kids!"" After further controversy over the issue among the school, alumni, gay activists and anti-gay activists, Timone's appearance was postponed until further notice but not officially cancelled.

148,"Erickatoure Aviance (or Ericka Toure Aviance) is an American nightlife personality, club host, clothing designer, fashionista, drag performer, recording artist, dancer, actor, singer and songwriter. She is a member of the House of Aviance, one of the vogue and ballroom houses in the U.S. founded in 1989 by Mother Juan Aviance. It is from this House that she takes her last name from as customary for all ballroom house members.


== Early life and education ==
Aviance was born into a mixed race family with a Black father and a White mother. She grew up in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and came out of the closet at a young age. Although a trained dancer, she started off doing theatre and didn't enter the dance field until she was 14 years of age. She attended New York University with a dance scholarship and in 1999, progressed to the Tisch School of the Arts and majored in dance.


== Career ==
During Aviance's career as a drag artist working in nightclubs, she met the entertainer Jonny McGovern who later became a friend and encouraged her to explore her drag character and make her own music. In her earlier years as an artist in New York City, she drew great influences from the performances of her fellow Aviance House member Kevin Aviance. As Erickatoure narrates in an interview with The Huffington Post:

Nightlife introduced me to the wonder of Kevin Aviance. His performances in my early years in NYC were extremely influential. I found him captivating, dynamic and inspiring. He was completely his own creation unlike anything I'd ever seen before. His command over an audience was enrapturing – his spiritual essence could envelope an entire room. The gravitas he had as a performer is always in the back of my mind when I create anything and every time I perform.
In 2009, Aviance released her EP Work Ericka, and soon after released the music video for her single My Pumps collaborating with artist one-half NelSon who constructed all the looks in that video. Aviance also started the performance art group enSUBTITLES with one-half NelSon and Clifton Brown.
Aviance was part of La'Mady, a transgender rap group that included Koko Aviance, Linda James, and DJ Nita Aviance. The group collaborated with Jonny McGovern in his 2006 album Jonny McGovern Presents: This is NYC, Bitch! The East Village Mixtape , with Aviance featuring in the track Showgirl as well as on This is New York City (BITCH!). In that album, she also appeared with the La'Mady group on Runway in My Street Clothes. The track This is New York City (BITCH!) produced by Jonny McGovern, and written by Jonny McGovern, DJ Nita Aviance and Linda James also became a single for La'Mady and featured Kevin Aviance.
Aviance also Appeared on Jonny McGovern and Lady Red Couture's premiere Hey Qween TV's show Pimp My Drag! (a drag makeover show) in 2017 with Adam Joseph and one-half NelSon, and in 2016 and 2017 appeared on the Hey Qween Show as a guest, starring Jonny McGovern. The music video for her 2017 single OVAH released on Aviance Records was first published on Jonny McGovern and Lady Red Couture's  Hey Qween YouTube channel on June 26, 2017.


== Controversy involving Wendy Williams ==
In 2009, Aviance was reported to have been kicked out of The Wendy Williams Show by Wendy Williams and her team for wearing a dress and a wig. It is alleged that: ""Erickatoure Aviance was told she couldn't sit in the studio audience of The Wendy Williams Show because the show had a strict ""no costume policy"". Aviance responded to the incident by calling it ""particularly offensive"", and went on to add that ""Williams has compared herself to a drag queen on the show multiple times."" After receiving many complaints, and GLAAD getting involved, the show's officials issued an apology, changed their policy, and invited Aviance back on the show. In 2017 when Wendy Williams was supposed to do the pre-show for RuPaul's Drag Race, former contestant Detox, drag performer Stephanie Stone, and recording artist and RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage took to social media and brought up the 2009 humiliation of Erickatoure on The Wendy Williams Show by referring to Wendy Williams as transphobic and not an ally of the LGBT community. That sentiment was echoed by RuPaul's Drag Race's All-Stars season 2 winner Alaska Thunderfuck who referred to Wendy William's coverage of Caitlyn Jenner's transition as ""transphobic"".

Pantoja's career as a transvestite performer began when he was auditioning for a role in a theater production, and the only one left was a woman's part. He accepted the challenge to portray that role, and it was an epiphany. From then on, it became his primary career.
He wrote over 20 club acts, which he took throughout Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the United States, Mexico and Perú. He also hosted his own talk show, Estoy aquí (I'm Here), on WIPR-TV, channel 6-affiliated broadcasting (from PBS).
A seasoned night club varieté entertainer, Pantojas made waves beginning in the Puerto Rico night club scene during the 1970s, with his musical incendiary political satires and his gender-bending characters. A versatile thespian, he played roles as diverse as Estragon and Pozzo in Waiting for Godot, Juliet in El público (The Audience) by Federico García Lorca (in its world premiere in Puerto Rico in 1978), and the small-time street-wise narrator in La verdadera historia de Pedro Navaja, one of the longest-running plays in Puerto Rico's history, based on the Three Penny Opera. Pantojas produced, directed, taught, wrote and performed for more than 12 years for the Productora Nacional de Teatro, Inc., a department from the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña (National Cultural Ministry) in Puerto Rico from which he staged his versions of Alexandre Dumas, fils’ Camille, Lorca's La casa de Bernarda Alba (The House of Bernarda Alba), Jules Tasca, An American Comedy, Venezuelan Isaac Chocrón's  La revolución (The Revolution), Argentine Alejandro Robino's Manzana podrida (Rotten Apple) and Chilean Marco Antonio De la Parra's La secreta obscenidad de cada día (The Secret Obscenity of Every Day), as well as the theatrical versions of Weekend at Bernie's and The Full Monty. Pantojas also appeared in various plays, including La Cage Aux Folles (The Bird's Cage), as ""Zaza"" and ""Albin"", and Love, Valour and Compassion as ""Buzz"". As a playwright, he took several workshops in New York City (writing) and Florence (creativity).


== Recent years ==
In 2003, Pantojas moved to New York, and decided that due to his age he would not perform again as a transvestite actor. Pantojas stated that his face and his body had changed, and as he was a versatile actor, he could carry out different roles, pursuing his career as a performer in many ways.
He portrayed a priest, Father Amado, in the theater production El silencio es salud (Silence Is Health), performed at the Centro Cultural Clemente Soto Vélez (The Clemente Soto Cultural Center) in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and he was featured as Amalia in the motion picture Under My Nails (2012).
He died of a heart attack on October 2, 2017.

154,"Silky Nutmeg Ganache (born December 31, 1989) is an American drag performer from Chicago, Illinois, who came to international attention in 2019 when she competed on the eleventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race finishing in third place, and later competed on the sixth season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2021. She has also been involved in numerous Drag Race spin-offs, including RuPaul's Drag Race: Vegas Revue (2020) and RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race (2022). She also competed in the first Canadian-based international All Stars spin-off series, Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World in 2022, finishing as a runner-up.


== Early life and education ==
Silky Nutmeg Ganache was born on December 30, 1989, into an African American Pentecostal family in Moss Point, Mississippi, but eventually moved to Chicago as a young adult. Growing up, she was an avid fan of the Food Network, and most frequently watched Emeril Lagasse’s programs. She is a Hurricane Katrina survivor, and, as a result of the flooding sustained during the natural disaster, only a few visual records of her childhood exists. She came out to her family as gay when she was in her senior year of high school. She graduated from Moss Point High School in 2008.  She earned her MBA in organizational leadership from Indiana Wesleyan University in December 2017. According to Silky Nutmeg Ganache's website, she is currently pursuing her PhD. Because of her Master's and PhD pursuit, she is often jokingly referred to as ""The Reverend Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache"".
She went to Wabash College, an all-male college, where she came out as gay to her college community during her junior year of college, and she thought of her original drag name, ""Lasagna Frozeen"", which was considered alongside the name ""Honeybutta Biscuit Superbottom"". The name ""Lasagna Frozeen"" originated from when Silky Nutmeg Ganache drank too much at parties and her peers gave her the nickname ""Lasagna"", quipping that ""Lasagna was coming out"" whenever she had drunk too much alcohol. She had first discovered drag during her senior year of college, when, over spring break, she attended a drag show at nearby DePauw University. Her drag mother and mentor, Vanessa Ryan, later dubbed her ""Silky"" because she could be rough around the edges but also classy. One night, Silky went home where she watched the Food Network, and, while watching a program, she overheard the phrase ""silky ganache."" She added “nutmeg”, a nickname she had gained while working in food services to the name, and, from there, she would hence be known as ""Silky Nutmeg Ganache"". She considers the anniversary of her first time performing in drag to be March 18, 2012. Silky Nutmeg Ganache graduated from Wabash College the same year.

155,"Sir Lady Java, also known simply as Lady Java (born 1943) is an American transgender rights activist, exotic dancer, singer, comedian, and actress. Active on stage, television, radio and film from the mid-1960s to 1970s, she is a popular and influential personality in the Los Angeles-area African-American LGBT community.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1943. Java transitioned at a young age with the support of her mother, and began singing and dancing in local nightclubs.


=== Career and legal battle ===
Sir Lady moved to Los Angeles, California, where in the mid-'60s she met and befriended Little Richard; they remained close for decades. By 1965, she had become a mainstay of the nightclub circuit, where she was associated with such figures as Redd Foxx, Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, Rudy Ray Moore, LaWanda Page and Don Rickles. Lady Java cited Lena Horne, Mae West, and Josephine Baker as inspirations for her performances, which involved dancing, impersonations, singing, and comedy. She was frequently featured in such magazines as Jet, HEP, the LA Advocate, and Variety.
In the early fall of 1967, after a successful two-week engagement at Redd Foxx's club which Java was seeking to extend, the Los Angeles Police Department began shutting down the now-famous Java's performances, citing Rule Number 9, a local ordinance prohibiting the ""impersonation by means of costume or dress a person of the opposite sex,"" and threatening to fine clubs that hosted her. In response, Java picketed Redd Foxx's club on October 21 and hired the American Civil Liberties Union in a bid to overturn the rule. The courts eventually rejected Java's case with the ACLU, stipulating that only club owners could sue. Rule Number 9 ultimately was struck down after a separate dispute in 1969.
In 1978, Java performed with Lena Horne at a birthday party for nightclub owner and columnist Gertrude Gipson.


=== Later years ===
From the 1980s, Java kept a lower public profile. Since retiring from performance and recovering from a stroke, she has made a limited return to public life, appearing locally in southern California and giving interviews. In June 2016, she was a guest of honor at the 18th annual Trans Pride L.A. festival alongside CeCe McDonald. Java also participated in the 2022 Los Angeles Pride Parade as Community Grand Marshal. Java has been recognized as a trailblazer.

158,"Jovan Jordan Bridges (born August 22, 1993), known by the stage name Yvie Oddly, is an American drag queen, performer, fashion designer, rapper, and recording artist from Denver, Colorado who came to international attention in 2019 when she won the eleventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race. She later returned to compete on the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, an all-winners season, in 2022. Oddly has been on the worldwide Werq the World drag concert tour since 2019. In addition to music videos and performances, she explores what she sees as a transformative power of drag by making thrift store finds into wearable art in Yvie Oddly's Oddities series on WOW Presents Plus. She released her debut album, Drag Trap, in 2020.


== Early life and education ==
Jovan Bridges was born on August 22, 1993, in Denver, Colorado. As a child, she played with her mother's makeup and dressed in her sister's clothes, ""When I was a six-year-old boy playing dress-up in my sister's tutus and makeup, my parents were like, 'Take that off.' And I was like, 'Why?' I felt pretty and I'd sleep in a skirt every night."" She participated in gymnastics and other strenuous extracurricular activities until she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome at age fifteen. She began musical theatre as an alternative.
Bridges describes her first exposure to drag as taking place in middle school, when a classmate dressed up as a hooker for Halloween and attracted significant attention. The following Halloween, Bridges dressed as a hooker and enjoyed both her peers' shock and admiration. Bridges attended East High School, and went to college at the Auraria Campus, both in Denver.


== Career ==


=== Early career ===
Oddly started her career as Avon Eve, performing for her first time at the Center in Denver, CO. before moving on to performing at Broadways Bar in a show hosted by Mile High Pinky Pie.
Oddly committed to drag after seeing Sharon Needles on the fourth season of RuPaul's Drag Race which aired in 2012, stating that ""[Sharon Needles] was spooky. Her makeup was terrible. She was more dedicated to art and wit than being a glamorous female impersonator."" Prior to this, Oddly did not embrace all the opportunities that being a drag artist offered, as she considered herself just a ""skinny, black, gay guy.""
Oddly started doing drag during college in 2012 when Venus D'lite from RuPaul's Drag Race hosted a workshop on the college campus for Valentine's Day, stating that she ""attempted some drag (or ghost) makeup, put on a super-cheap red wig and dress, and backflipped my way through ""Scheiße"" by Lady Gaga"". Her first performances were at Denver's gay bar Tracks. The name 'Yvie Oddly' came from her pun to express ""being even odder than anybody else""; Oddly soon developed a reputation for having ""outrageous and unconventional looks on stage"". Her ingenuity came from financial necessity as making the ""most glamorous or the most expensive"" looks was not an option, saying that ""I've just always liked to work with the materials that I have around me."" In 2014, Oddly was an extra in the music video for Sharon Needles's ""Dressed to Kill.""
Oddly was the winner of the Ultimate Queen of Denver pageant in 2015. Later that summer, Oddly became a cast member of Drag Nation; opened for pop star Mya on the Main Stage for PrideFest; and performed in Bohemia's The Prohibition of Lust. She was also in the music video for Adore Delano's ""Negative Nancy"" in 2017.
In 2017, Oddly stated that she used drag to confront gender roles. In 2018, when asked about her drag aesthetics, Oddly said that she liked to shock and surprise with something the audience had not seen before, including dramatic looks, even employing unconventional and found materials. In 2019, she described herself as a drag queen who blends ""artistry, fashion, performance and concept"". She draws inspiration from French fashion designer Thierry Mugler, British designer and haute couturier Alexander McQueen, and 'terrorist' drag queen Christeene.
In 2018, Oddly was both the manager at her Denver home drag bar as well as a drag queen, and was looking to transform her drag into a full-time job. She felt the time to make a drastic life change was imminent even if her audition tape did not get her onto RuPaul's Drag Race.


=== RuPaul's Drag Race ===
Oddly was announced as a cast member in season eleven of RuPaul's Drag Race in January 2019; it was her third time to apply as a contestant. She is the second queen from Denver to compete on Drag Race, after Nina Flowers. During the competition Oddly was noted for her eccentric and conceptual looks, her performance ability and her quirky and outspoken personality, she quickly became a fan and judges favorite. Oddly said the time of the competition was somewhat lonely as she was unable to talk to friends or family. She spoke about her motives for competing on the show:

""It starts to be seen through this two-dimensional perspective of what we expect from drag ... because I've seen a formula building up, where if you have a lot of money and you wear something really sparkly ... the general public is going to fall in love with you. I wanted to shake that up and remind people that this art form is a queer art form.""
Oddly was the winner of the second episode main challenge with Scarlet Envy. She spent six weeks in a row placing in the top of the competition which makes her the queen with the most times in a row placing in the top after Jinkx Monsoon with eight times. In the eighth episode, however, she and Brooke Lynn Hytes both ""bombed"" on Snatch Game, the show's parody of celebrity-led Match Game. Brooke Lynn Hytes and Oddly were the bottom two queens and had to lip-sync battle to Demi Lovato's ""Sorry Not Sorry"" widely seen as one of the best battles in the show's history, causing RuPaul to keep both competitors.
During the show, she was in a constant rivalry with fellow competitor Silky Nutmeg Ganache. When asked by RuPaul who should go home Silky named Oddly because of her twisted ankle even though Oddly completed the choreography, Oddly named Silky as the one who should leave because she was resistant to critiques from RuPaul and the other judges. Entertainment site Gold Derby held a poll with 94% siding with Oddly. During the March 21 episode, while the queens were being taught some complex choreography for a live production of the political satire Trump: The Rusical, Oddly revealed she had to be careful about dropping to the ground as her joints often popped out of place. She has a connective tissue disorder called Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type 3 which means she doesn't produce as much collagen. Hers is a subtype that is known as hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS). Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are associated with faulty collagen production and collagen-modifying enzymes.
In the penultimate episode, the final five queens wrote, recorded, danced, and performed a verse in a single-shot video hip-hop version of RuPaul's ""Queens Everywhere"". Out said Oddly's performance was the best with her work on point and well performed. They added, ""Her risks, boldness, and weirdo ideas have often landed her harsh critiques and enemies on the show — but at least she's out here taking risks"". Judge Todrick Hall later apologized for calling her choreography spastic, he was told by fans in the United Kingdom that it was a taboo thing to say in that country. The judges praised her performance, her verse and her final runway look, and she received the best critiques of the night making her the first queen to be named by RuPaul to move to the finale. Of the top four she was the only one without multiple challenge wins, but also had the fewest times landing in the bottom two, along with rival Silky Nutmeg Ganache.
In the season finale, held in Los Angeles' Orpheum Theatre, Oddly was in the final three and lip-sync battled against A'keria Davenport to Rihanna's ""SOS"", which she won. For that she wore a dress decorated with stuffed animals toys and neon fake fur. Oddly then faced off in the final lip-sync against Brooke Lynn Hytes to Lady Gaga's ""The Edge of Glory"", which she also won. She had already shown she could deliver impressive physical performances, so refrained from stunts or gags, and worked to ""connect to the song, and deliver a strong artistic performance that would hopefully still get my voice out as an artist.""
For the final battle Oddly wore a distinctive headpiece with mirrors that from the front made her look like she had three faces, and on the back was a second mask, the headpiece was made by Darrell Thorne, while Kristi Siedow-Thompson designed the dress. Her parents, who had not spoken to one another in years, sat together in the audience in support. Oddly was declared the winner of Season 11 of Drag Race, and ""America's Next Drag Superstar"", on May 30, 2019. She encouraged the audience to ""Follow your oddities and fly your freak flag!"" Oddly also set a record with having the fewest challenge wins of any winner in RuPaul's Drag Race history, a record later tied by her drag sister and season 14 winner Willow Pill.
Oddly's win is the latest in a series of title wins by black queer and trans people in drag pageants and leather competitions, a turnaround for LGBTQ communities. She feels that queer people of color have not been credited enough for their contributions to queer culture. Oddly is ""part Black, part Caucasian, and some part Native American."" Additionally she says, ""there's been so much debate on my race: whether or not I'm Black, whether or not colorism is at play."" Her anger at being disrespected by the gay community because of being Black prompted her to get into drag.
In Episode 1 of All Stars 5, Yvie made a guest appearance as a ""Lip Sync Assassin"", where she lip-synced against India Ferrah and won.


=== Werq the World tour to present ===
Oddly was criticized, especially on social media, for not elevating her looks to befit her title of Drag Queen Superstar, while also being awarded the $100,000 prize. She pointed out that she was a poor Black drag queen with no connections in the larger drag world with humble roots who put everything into her art when she won. By her first DragCon the only thing that had changed were the connections. She said, ""so I spent the next nine months paying back the debt of being THE FIRST winner of my kind since the show's mainstream crossover."" She was repeatedly called 'garbage' so decided to reclaim the concept with her looks. ""If you refuse to see the ideals behind my choices then it's because you operate from a place of privilege where fashion and drag don't have to speak to your life circumstances, especially not socioeconomically"".

Oddly was a part of the 2019 North American leg of the Werq the World tour, a multi-year international drag concert tour hosted by Michelle Visage and featuring RuPaul's Drag Race queens. The tour visited seventeen cities throughout North America, including five in Canada. It began in Los Angeles during RuPaul's DragCon LA and ended in September in New York City during RuPaul's DragCon NYC. The tour continued to major cities in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, ending in November.
In June 2019, Oddly performed at Denver's PrideFest, the city's annual LGBTQ pride parade and festival, and hosted ""Drag Nation"" at her home bar Tracks. Her first post-win U.K. performance was at Bournemouth's DYMK. As part of Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019, the world's largest LGBTQ event, Oddly will perform at the June 26th Opening Ceremony benefiting the Ali Forney Center, Immigration Equality, and Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE), and at the LadyLand Festival June 28.
In June 2019 World of Wonder, the production company behind RuPaul's Drag Race, announced Oddly will star in her own reality show series, Yvie Oddly's Oddities aired worldwide on WOW Presents Plus. It follows the bargain-hunting queen to thrift stores where she shops for ""throwaway items to turn one queen's trash into her jaw-dropping fashion treasures"". Oddly explained that, ""Drag is all about the power of transformation."" However, as of 2023, the series is yet to air.

In July 2019, she was criticized for no longer doing selfies after shows citing being physically exhausted; she later added that she had to set boundaries. Her genetic condition Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) results in chronic pain so she foregoes post-show selfies for more meaningful interactions. Appearing on Drag Race, let alone winning, put Oddly on a steep learning curve to transform every aspect of her drag art into a business. It also forced her to re-evaluate what she could physically do—as contorting her body in performances takes a toll—while still delivering a drag experience for her audiences. Oddly stated,""It's about taking a step back and having a conversation with whatever you're doing. A lot of people are just go, go, go. But you need to see what things are working, what things aren't working, and how to manipulate them in your favor, and think about the people that you're actually making it for.""
In September 2019, at RuPaul's DragCon NYC, Oddly was named as one of a rotating cast of a dozen Drag Race queens in RuPaul's Drag Race Live!, a Las Vegas show residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas.
When asked about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its required social distancing and stay-at-home orders (starting in March 2020), Oddly remarked that it brought her back to her roots of being creative at home with her roommates. She also feels it frees her to tell more complete stories via video when she can layer performances atop one another, ""[until now] I haven't really had a whole lot of time to invest back into the artistry of my drag and to do one-off performances and really throw my all into the creative concept.""
In April 2022, Oddly was announced as one of the eight returning winners that would be competing in seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, the first ever all-winners season of Drag Race.


== Personal life ==
Oddly has been diagnosed with type 3 Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS). With her heightened status, she has found a content community of people living with hEDS, and other invisible disabilities, who call themselves ""zebras"", as they have more exotic diseases than doctors would expect. The condition as well as the chronic pain of her ""bones grinding"" leave her depleted after performing so she foregoes post-show photo ops for more meaningful interactions.
Oddly is the grandchild of Denver Black Panther's leader Lauren Watson. Oddly married Doug Illsley in July 2023.
As a drag queen, she is the drag sister of Willow Pill, who won the fourteenth season of RuPaul's Drag Race.
Oddly is genderqueer, and uses she/he/they pronouns

159,"José Julio Sarria (December 13, 1922 – August 19, 2013), also known as The Grand Mere, Absolute Empress I de San Francisco, and the Widow Norton, was an American political activist from San Francisco, California, who, in 1961, became the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States. He is also remembered for performing as a drag queen at the Black Cat Bar and as the founder of the Imperial Court System.


== Family history ==
José Sarria was born in San Francisco, California, to Maria Dolores Maldonado and Julio Sarria. His family was of Spanish and Colombian origin. His mother Maria was born in Bogotá to an upper class and politically active family. During the events of the Thousand Days War and following her mother's death, Maria sought out the protection of her mother's friend, General Rafael Uribe Uribe, to escape Colombia. The general located Maria's surviving uncle, who took her to the American consulate. There she was made a ward of the United States and relocated to Panama. ""My mother got to Panama with directions to the home of a family called Kopp. He was the chairman of the big German beer company there"", said Sarria. ""She went to work for the Kopps. ... My mother was the upstairs maid and took care of the children."" In 1919, she relocated to Guatemala City but remained there for just six months and, in 1920, sailed to San Francisco. As Sarria reported it, ""Now on the boat is where my mother met my father, Julio Sarria. He came from a large and very wealthy family, very well known. ... His grandparents came from Spain.""
Maria initially worked for the woman who sponsored her passage to the United States and then took a job as a maid with a family named Jost. Julio was the maitre d' at the Palace Hotel. Julio courted Maria until she realized she was pregnant. Their son José was born on December 12. His birth certificate reads 1923 but Sarria believed he was born in 1922. Julio and Maria never married.


== Early life ==
Sarria's mother continued to work for the Jost family, but it became increasingly difficult for her to fulfill her job responsibilities and care for an infant. Maria made arrangements for him to be raised by another couple, Jesserina and Charles Millen. Jesserina had recently lost her youngest child to diphtheria and suffered severe depression. Her doctor suggested she take in another child to raise and, after meeting with her, Maria agreed to let her raise José. José came to consider the Millens and their children to be his second family. Maria bought a house and moved the Millens and José into it.
Sarria did not have a relationship with his birth father, a man who showed no interest in him and failed to provide his family with financial support. Julio Sarria was eventually arrested for failure to pay child support. A judge ordered that he pay $5 to be released; this money was then turned over for Jose's care. Julio was arrested each month until he returned to Nicaragua in around 1926 or 1927; each time he paid the $5 and was released. Julio died in Nicaragua in 1945. Years later, José learned that his father had acknowledged him as his first-born.
Sarria attended the Emerson School for kindergarten and then, because he spoke only Spanish, was sent to private schools until learning English. Sarria began dressing in female clothes at an early age and his family indulged him, allowing him occasionally to go on family outings dressed as a girl. In his youth, he studied ballet, tap dance, and singing.
When Sarria was around ten years old, he asked his mother how much money they had in the bank. Maria, who gave her money to her employer Mr. Jost to invest, asked to see the books. She discovered that Jost had been embezzling from her and from the other women whom she had referred to him. Jost was arrested, convicted and deported. Maria sued Jost's corporate partners and received a settlement but never recovered the bulk of the money. Unable to afford her house payments, Maria moved José and the Millen family to Redwood City in 1932.
As a teenager, Sarria enrolled in Commerce High School, where he took advanced classes in French and German. With his Spanish and English, these brought his total languages to four. His facility with languages led to his first serious relationship with another man. Sarria tutored Paul Kolish, an Austrian baron who fled to Switzerland when the Nazis invaded Austria. He brought with him his wife and son Jonathan, each of whom suffered from asthma and tuberculosis. When his wife died, he brought Jonathan to America. Kolish found himself falling in love with his tutor and Sarria's family welcomed him and his son. Sarria graduated from high school and enrolled in college to study home economics.


== Military service ==

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Sarria became determined to join the military, despite being, at just under 5 feet (1.52 meters) tall, too short to meet the Army's height requirement. He seduced a major who was attached to the San Francisco recruiting station on the condition that the major approve Sarria's enlistment. Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his studies as he waited to be called up to active duty. Shortly before he was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack. Sarria's induction was delayed a month, then he was sworn in and ordered to Sacramento, California, for basic training with the Signal Corps.
Because of his fluency in several languages, Sarria was assigned to Intelligence School. However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that he would no longer be in the program. Sarria assumed that it was because investigators discovered his homosexuality. ""I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn't the most masculine guy in town ... So I think that they figured that I was a little bit gay."" Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he was assigned to train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment. He was then assigned to the motor pool.
Through his work at the motor pool, Sarria met a young officer named Major Mataxis. He became the major's orderly, eventually running an officers' mess in occupied Germany where he cooked for Mataxis and about ten other officers. He was discharged from the Army in 1947, at the rank of Staff Sergeant.
Upon Sarria's return from overseas, Kolish began to worry about their future. The United States had no legal recognition for same-sex relationships and Kolish looked for a way to provide for Sarria after Kolish's death. He proposed marriage to Sarria's mother Maria. Maria was willing, but José refused to allow it. Given no other choice, Kolish contacted his only remaining adult relative, a brother who lived in Hollywood, and left instructions for the care of Sarria and his family.
On Christmas Day 1947, Kolish and his son were struck by a drunk driver while driving to spend the holiday with Sarria and his family. Both were killed. The coroner determined that Jonathan died first, meaning that Paul's brother inherited everything. The brother ignored Paul's wishes regarding Sarria. ""I would have gotten one of the houses"", Sarria claimed, ""but he only gave me a little money and one ring. He claimed that was all Paul wanted me to have. He was so evil. He said afterwards, 'If you expect anything else, you're not going to get it.' ""


== The Nightingale of Montgomery Street ==
Following his military service, Sarria returned to San Francisco. He enrolled in college with plans of becoming a teacher. He and his sister Teresa began frequenting the Black Cat Bar, a center of the city's beat and bohemian scene. Sarria and Teresa both became smitten with a waiter named Jimmy Moore and bet as to which of them could get him into bed first. José won the bet and soon Moore and he were lovers. Sarria began covering for Moore when he was unable to work and soon Black Cat owner Sol Stoumen hired him as a cocktail waiter.
At around this time, Sarria was arrested for solicitation in a sting operation at the St. Francis Hotel. Sarria maintained his innocence, stating that the arresting officer knew him personally. ""But they had to make an example of somebody ... I was in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Nonetheless, he was convicted and subjected to a large fine. Sarria, understanding that his conviction meant he could never become certified as a teacher, dropped out of college. Unsure of how to find work, he took the advice of a drag performer named Michelle and entered a drag contest at an Oakland bar called Pearl's. Sarria took second place, winning a two-week performance contract at the bar at $50 a week. ""I decided then to be the most notorious impersonator or homosexual or fairy or whatever you wanted to call me–and you would pay me for it."" Returning to San Francisco, he picked up some small singing jobs while still cocktail waiting at the Black Cat.
One night at the Black Cat, Sarria recognized the piano player's rendition of Bizet's opera Carmen and began singing arias from the opera while he delivered drinks. This quickly led to a schedule of three to four shows a night, along with a regular Sunday afternoon show. Sarria was billed as ""The Nightingale of Montgomery Street"". Initially he focused on singing parodies of popular torch songs. Soon, however, Sarria was performing full-blown parodic operas in his natural high tenor. His specialty was a re-working of Carmen set in modern-day San Francisco. Sarria as Carmen would prowl through the popular cruising area Union Square. The audience cheered ""Carmen"" on as she dodged the vice squad and made her escape.
Sarria encouraged patrons to be as open and honest as possible. ""People were living double lives and I didn't understand it. It was persecution. Why be ashamed of who you are?"" He exhorted the clientele, ""There's nothing wrong with being gay–the crime is getting caught"", and ""United we stand, divided they catch us one by one"". At closing time he would call upon patrons to join hands and sing ""God Save Us Nelly Queens"" to the tune of ""God Save the Queen"". Sometimes he would bring the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail, who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night. Speaking of this ritual in the film Word is Out, gay journalist George Mendenhall said:

It sounds silly, but if you lived at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere to turn ... and to be able to put your arms around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing 'God Save Us Nelly Queens' ... we were really not saying 'God Save Us Nelly Queens.' We were saying 'We have our rights, too.'
Sarria fought against police harassment, both of gays and of gay bars. Raids on gay bars were routine, with everyone inside the raided bar taken into custody and charged with such crimes as being ""inmates in a disorderly house"". Although the charges were routinely dropped, the arrested patrons' names, addresses and workplaces were printed in the newspapers. When charges were not dropped, the arrested men usually quietly pleaded guilty. Sarria encouraged men to plead not guilty and demand a jury trial. Following Sarria's advice, more and more gay men began demanding jury trials, so many that court dockets were overloaded and judges began expecting that prosecutors have actual evidence against the accused before going to trial. One favored harassment technique, employed especially on Halloween after midnight, was to arrest drag queens under an old city ordinance that made it illegal for a man to dress in women's clothing with an ""intent to deceive"". In consultation with attorney Melvin Belli, Sarria countered this tactic by distributing labels to his fellow drag queens (hand-made, in the shape of a black cat's head) that read ""I am a boy"". If confronted, the queen would simply display the tag to prove that there was no intent to deceive. Sarria's actions helped bring an end to Halloween police raids. Along with Guy Strait, Sarria formed the League for Civil Education (LCE) in 1960 or 1961. The LCE, like other homophile organizations, ran educational programs on the topic of homosexuality and provided support for men being ostracized for being gay and for those caught in police raids.


== Political candidacy ==

During an intensive period of police pressure after the 1959 San Francisco mayoral election, in which the supposed leniency of city government toward homosexuals became an issue, Sarria ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1961, becoming the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States. Although Sarria never expected to win
he almost did win by default. On the last day for candidates to file petitions, city officials realized that there were fewer than five candidates running for the five open seats, which would have guaranteed Sarria a seat. By the end of the day, a total of 34 candidates had filed. LCE co-founder Strait began printing the LCE News in part to support Sarria's candidacy. Sarria garnered some 6,000 votes in the citywide race, finishing ninth. This was not enough to win a seat but was enough to shock political pundits and set in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics. ""[He] put the gay vote on the map"", said Terence Kissack, former executive director of the GLBT Historical Society. ""He made it visible and showed there was a constituency."" As Sarria put it, ""From that day on, nobody ran for anything in San Francisco without knocking on the door of the gay community.""
In 1962, Sarria along with bar owners and employees formed the Tavern Guild, the country's first gay business association. The Guild raised money for legal fees and bail for people arrested at gay bars and helped bar owners coordinate their response to the harassment by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and the police.
Sarria continued to perform and agitate at the Black Cat until, after some 15 years of unrelenting police pressure, the bar lost its liquor license in 1963. The Black Cat stayed open as a luncheonette for a few more months before finally closing for good in February 1964.


== José I, The Widow Norton ==
With the demise of the Black Cat, Sarria helped found the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) in 1963. SIR grew out of a split between Sarria and Strait over the direction that LCE was heading. Strait and his supporters wanted to focus more on publishing the group's newsletter, while Sarria and his backers wanted to maintain focus on street-level organizing. SIR sponsored both social and political functions, including bowling leagues, bridge clubs, voter registration drives and ""Candidates' Nights"" and published its own magazine, Vector. In association with the Tavern Guild, SIR printed and distributed ""Pocket Lawyers"". These pocket-sized guides offered advice on what to do if arrested or harassed by police. SIR lasted for 17 years.
Crowned Queen of the Beaux Arts Ball in 1964 by the Tavern Guild, Sarria, stating that he was ""already a queen"", proclaimed himself ""Her Royal Majesty, Empress of San Francisco, José I, The Widow Norton"".  Sarria devised the name ""Widow Norton"" as a reference to the much-celebrated citizen of 19th century San Francisco, Joshua Norton, who had declared himself Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico in 1859. Sarria organized elaborate annual pilgrimages to lay flowers on Norton's grave in the Woodlawn Cemetery in Colma, California. He purchased a plot adjacent to Norton's where he is now interred.
Sarria's assumption of the title of Empress led to the establishment of the Imperial Court System, a network of non-profit charitable organizations throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico that raises money for various beneficiaries.  Sarria is much revered within the hierarchy of the Imperial Court System and is affectionately and informally known as ""Mama"" or ""Mama José"" among Imperial Court members. The ""José Honors Awards"" are presented to Imperial Court dignitaries and others in a bi-annual banquet held in Sarria's honor.


== Restaurateur ==
In 1964, Sarria went into business with restaurateur Pierre Parker, who owned restaurants called ""Lucky Pierre"" in Carmel, California, and New York City. They met when Parker wandered into the Black Cat one night and they struck up a friendship. In addition to his restaurants, Parker held the French food concession for the World's Fair. He invited Sarria to join him at the 1964 New York World's Fair.
While working at the Fair, Sarria learned that his longtime companion, Jimmy Moore, had died. Moore had been a frequent drinker throughout their relationship and had been arrested a number of times for public drunkenness. A judge finally told Moore that the next time he was arrested he would be given the maximum sentence. Moore was arrested again and, scared of a long prison term, hanged himself in jail. Although devastated, Sarria could not come home from the exposition. At the end of the season he returned and he and Moore's father consoled each other. ""And so, that ended my big romance. The great love of my life. It carried on for nine years.""
Sarria and Parker worked together through both seasons of the New York fair, Expo 67 in Montreal, HemisFair '68 in San Antonio, Texas and Expo '74 in Spokane, Washington, after which Sarria retired. He and Parker moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where Sarria lived until returning to San Francisco in 1977. He remained politically active, endorsing the candidacies of Harvey Milk for the Board of Supervisors. In 1977, Milk would win the board seat that Sarria had sought in 1961.


== Later life ==
Sarria and members of the Imperial Court appeared along with other notable drag queens in the 1995 film To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. They played the judges of the ""Drag Queen of the Year Contest"" that opened the film.

In 2005, Sarria found himself at the center of a legal controversy over his role on the jury in the 1991 murder trial of Clifford Bolden. Bolden had been sentenced to death in 1991 for the 1986 murder of Henry Michael Pederson, whom Bolden allegedly picked up in a bar in San Francisco's Castro district. Bolden's attorneys claimed that Sarria, who was not on the jury that convicted Bolden but was seated as an alternate for the penalty phase, had known Bolden's lover, Pederson and another of the jurors. They alleged that he had concealed this knowledge in order to remain on the jury and push for a death sentence. Sarria acknowledged having spoken occasionally with the other juror but denied the rest of the allegations. Sarria was cleared of wrongdoing in February 2008.
Sarria was honored in 2005 with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Celebration Committee's Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award. On May 25, 2006, Sarria's lifetime of activism was commemorated when the city of San Francisco renamed a section of 16th Street in the Castro to José Sarria Court. A plaque outlining Sarria's accomplishments is embedded in the sidewalk in front of the Harvey Milk Memorial Branch of the San Francisco Public Library, which is located at 1 José Sarria Court.
In 2009, the California State Assembly honored Sarria during an official celebration of LGBT Pride Month on June 21.
Sarria reigned over the Imperial Court System until February 17, 2007, abdicating the throne in favor of his first heir apparent, Nicole Murray-Ramirez, who assumed the title Empress Nicole the Great, Queen Mother of the Americas. This abdication marked the end of a 42-year reign of pioneering political activism and unforgettable queer pageantry.
Sarria left San Francisco in 1996, settling in the Palm Springs, California, area for more than a decade before moving to Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico, a suburb of Albuquerque. On granting Sarria its Lifetime Achievement Award in March 2012, Albuquerque Pride noted that he was living in Los Ranchos in ""a cute little casita and is enjoying his time raising chickens."" The ""casita"" was the guest house adjacent to the home of Tony Ross and his husband PJ Sedillo (also known as Fontana DeVine, Imperial Dowager Empress VI of the United Court of the Sandias); Ross and Sedillo served as Sarria's caregivers in the last three years of his life.


== Death ==
Sarria died of adrenal cancer at the age of 89 or 90 on August 19, 2013, at his home in Los Ranchos de Albuquerque.
 Obituaries and tributes appeared around the United States in media including The Advocate, KALW Public Radio (San Francisco), The New York Times, and the San Francisco Chronicle. Media outside the United States that reported the death include Gay Star News, an online newspaper based in London; Replika, a monthly LGBT magazine in Warsaw, Poland; Roze Golf, a regional LGBT radio program and online magazine based in Enschede, Netherlands; the website of RTVE, the Spanish national public television network; and Svenska Dagbladet, a daily newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden.
Sarria's imperial-drag-themed funeral was held on September 6, 2013, at Grace Cathedral of San Francisco, with the Right Rev. Marc Handley Andrus, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California, presiding; some 1,000 mourners attended the service. Various local and state elected officials participated, including California State Sen. Mark Leno, former San Francisco mayor Art Agnos, San Francisco Treasurer José Cisneros, and members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Leaders of the Imperial Court System and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence attended in full regalia, with the formal mourning dress for the court dictated by Sarria in advance. Other dignitaries at the funeral included Stuart Milk, nephew of politician Harvey Milk and head of the Harvey Milk Foundation.
Immediately following the funeral, a cortege of approximately 500 mourners accompanied Sarria's body to Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Colma, where he was buried with full military honors in a plot he had previously purchased at the foot of the grave of Joshua Norton.


== Archives & memorabilia ==
Sarria documented his public and private activities throughout his life, amassing an extensive collection of archival materials and artifacts. He donated the majority of his papers and memorabilia, along with a sampling of his costumes, to the GLBT Historical Society, an archives and research center in San Francisco. An initial donation came in 1996 followed by another substantial body of material in 2012.
In addition, Sarria gave a small selection of costumes, accessories and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress that he wore in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.
In 2016, a group of individuals associated with various Imperial Courts created the José Sarria Foundation to further Sarria's memory and legacy. One of the aims of the group is to gather and preserve a collection Sarria's costume jewelry and other personal belongings that were auctioned by his estate. Established as a 501(c)3 public charity in the state of Washington, the organization outlines its mission as follows: ""The foundation is dedicated to keeping José Julio Sarria's memory alive for future generations ... continuing his life's work of philanthropy, balanced with a healthy dose of fun.""


== Public commemorations ==
The San Francisco Pride Board created the José Julio Sarria History Makers award to honor LGBT people who make newsworthy accomplishments that were not going to get the recognition. It was created shortly before Sarria's death.
Sarria is one of the LGBT historic figures honored on the Rainbow Honor Walk in San Francisco's Castro District. A bronze plaque in Sarria's memory was dedicated as part of the honor walk on Castro Street in November 2017.
On Wednesday, June 12, 2019, José Sarria was featured in the daily segment: ""Pride Month F.Y.I."" on the television talk show The View during a Pride Month salute. A leading LGBTQ pioneer was featured every day during the month of June on the show.
In June 2019, Sarria was one of the inaugural fifty American ""pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes"" inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn.

161,"John Cabell ""Bunny"" Breckinridge (August 6, 1903 – November 5, 1996) was an American actor and drag queen, best known for his role as ""The Ruler"" in Ed Wood's film Plan 9 from Outer Space, his only film appearance.


== Early life ==
Breckinridge was born in Paris, France, to Adelaide Murphy and John Cabell Breckinridge Sr., a wealthy Californian family. He was the great-great-great-grandchild of U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge (and the great-grandchild of both U.S. Vice President and Confederate general John C. Breckinridge and Wells Fargo Bank founder Lloyd Tevis). He spent time at Eton College and Oxford University in England.


== Career ==


=== Plan 9 from Outer Space ===

In 1956, Breckinridge agreed to play the role of an alien leader in the film Graverobbers from Outer Space (later retitled Plan 9 from Outer Space), directed by his friend, Ed Wood. Wood and Breckinridge were introduced to one another by their mutual friend Paul Marco, who played Kelton the Cop in three Wood films. The film premiered March 15, 1957, at the Carlton Theatre in Hollywood.
Breckinridge and Marco were living together in the latter's modest home at the time, despite the fact that he was a struggling B-movie actor and Breckinridge was an independently wealthy socialite. David Demering, who played the airplane co-pilot in the film, also lived with them.
Breckinridge's previous stage experience convinced Wood to cast him as the alien ruler who oversees an attempt to take over the Earth using an army of reanimated corpses. Indeed, his background made him one of the few truly experienced actors in the entire cast. Dressed in a pajama-like outfit which is curiously less ornate than those worn by his underlings, he sports very visible mascara and lipstick, and constantly rolls his eyes and mugs for the camera.


=== Later years ===
Breckinridge continued his theatrical career throughout the 1950s, but in small local productions, such as playing the role of The Inquisitor in Richard Bailey's production of The Lark in Carmel.
By 1980, Plan 9 from Outer Space had amassed a cult following among B-movie buffs as the ""worst film ever made"", making Breckinridge's name known to a new generation. Meanwhile, he returned to stage acting, appearing mostly in local productions in San Francisco.
In 1994, Breckinridge was surprised to find himself portrayed as a character in a major motion picture, played by Bill Murray in Tim Burton's 1994 biopic Ed Wood. His advanced years and failing health, however, prevented him from participating in any of the publicity surrounding the film.


== Personal life ==
In 1927, while working as a drag/burlesque entertainer in Paris, he married Roselle du Val de Dampierre (1903–1999), the daughter of Robert Henri du Val de Dampierre, a French Count, and Marie du Val de Dampierre (née Serailler). They divorced two years later, but had one daughter, Solange Prasad.
Breckinridge maintained homes on each coast – one in New Jersey and one in San Francisco.
He died on November 5, 1996, at age 93, in a nursing home in Monterey, California. He was quoted in his obituary as saying, ""I was a little bit wild when I was young, darling, but I lived my life grandly.""


=== Sexuality ===
Openly gay at a time when it was daring (and even dangerous) to be so, he was well known for his flamboyant lifestyle, his outrageous sense of humor, and his penchant for perfume and costume jewelry. He performed in Shakespearean plays in England before moving to San Francisco in the late 1920s. He also frequently performed in drag.
In 1955, he was arrested in a San Francisco waterfront bar and charged with vagrancy and jailed, though the charges were later dropped because of his family and wealth.
In 1959, shortly after Plan 9 From Outer Space's disappointing DCA release, Breckinridge was convicted on ten counts of sex perversion for taking two underage boys on an excursion to Las Vegas. He was committed to the Atascadero State Hospital for the criminally insane, and released the following year.
Upon his release, he returned to his San Francisco home, a Spanish-style bungalow adorned with gold framed photographs of the many celebrities he met and befriended, including Princess Margaret, Noël Coward, J. Edgar Hoover, Elvis Presley, and Ed Sullivan. Breckinridge frequently opened his home to members of the growing hippie movement, who were enthralled not only by his stories of his flamboyant youth, but also his favorable opinions on free love and his encyclopedic knowledge of both gay history and the lives of closeted Hollywood stars.


=== Gender identity ===
In the 1940s, male-to-female sex change operations were becoming more widely available in Europe, and Breckinridge expressed many times his desire to undergo the procedure. With the nationwide attention given to Christine Jorgensen's sex change in 1952, Breckinridge became more determined than ever to begin transitioning. In 1954, he announced plans to travel to Denmark and undergo the operation so he could marry his male secretary. Breckinridge was by this time a grandparent, and his granddaughter supported him in his efforts. Shortly thereafter, a San Francisco judge scuttled his Denmark trip by ordering him into court for failing to make good on an earlier agreement to pay $8,500 a year to support his elderly, blind mother in England. He then made arrangements with a sex-change surgeon in Mexico, but had a serious car accident while traveling there. He gave up his pursuit of the matter afterwards.
In the 1960s, Breckinridge gave permission to the author Gore Vidal to write what Breckinridge thought would be a biography. However, though partly inspired by some events in real life, the bestselling book that resulted was a work of fiction: Myra Breckinridge.

== Life and career ==


=== 1989–2014: Early life and career beginnings ===
Brian Michael Firkus was born on August 23, 1989, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and raised in Silver Cliff, Wisconsin by a single mother with an older brother and a younger sister. He is Ojibwe and comes from a Native American family in Crivitz, Wisconsin. He had an abusive stepfather who would call him a ""Trixie"" when he acted feminine, which later inspired his drag name. Her last name was inspired by her affinity for the Barbie doll and toy company Mattel. Before deciding on ""Trixie Mattel"" as his drag name, he originally considered the name Cupcake. He moved in with his grandparents at age 15. His grandfather was a country musician who taught him how to play the guitar.
After graduating from high school, Firkus studied at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, where he received a BFA in musical theatre and was introduced to drag while performing in a production of The Rocky Horror Show at the Oriental Theatre. He first performed in drag at LaCage NiteClub in Milwaukee, becoming a regular performer in Milwaukee's drag scene. He would perform with fellow drag queens Kim Chi and Shea Couleé in Milwaukee, and would also occasionally perform in Chicago. He attended beauty school in 2014 before withdrawing to participate in RuPaul's Drag Race. Outside of drag, he worked in cosmetics at the time, freelancing at Sephora and working at Ulta and MAC.

The show ran until March 2018. Midway through the season, Zamolodchikova suffered a mental health crisis triggered by a relapse into addiction, which caused her to be replaced by Bob the Drag Queen for the remainder of the season. Mattel and Zamolodchikova later reunited in October 2018 for a third season of UNHhhh.
In November 2017, Mattel and Zamolodchikova starred in a drag stage adaptation of the 1997 cult film Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, entitled Trixie and Katya's High School Reunion.

She performed a comedy routine and danced to a mix of Missy Elliott and Gwen Stefani songs.

167,"Junior Larkin (died July 2017), also known by his stage name Kylie O'Reilly, was an Irish drag queen and gay rights activist.


== Career ==
Larkin came out and became involved in gay activism in 1993. Speaking at the reaction to the Gay and Lesbian Conference in 1994, Larkin said that he had been attacked four times in one year due to his sexuality.
Larkin was one of the staff of Gay Community News in the early 1990s, overseeing the layout and design of the magazine. He acted as mentor to the future editor of GCN, Brian Finnegan. Larkin was involved in the Dublin Lesbian and Gay Youth Group. With this group, he hosted the annual talent show with Anthony McGrath, called Search For A Star. The winner of the competition would be featured on a cover of GCN. He was also involved in the International Gay and Lesbian Youth Organisation.
In 1994 he co-wrote the book Coming Out: A Book For Lesbians and Gay Men of All Ages with the editor of GCN, Suzy Byrne. Both Larkin and Byrne appeared on The Late, Late Show to speak about the book. Larkin's appearance on the show led to him being recognised and attacked by a group of men near his flat on the Botanic Road. After Larkin left GCN he set up a free gay magazine, Guyz, as a glossy magazine but it was not successful due to the difficulty in securing sponsors.
Larkin was part of the 1995 information campaign by Out Youth, which sought to counter the rise in homophobic attacks in Dublin in the 1990s.
With John Pickering and Eddie McGuinness, Larkin formed the first all-gay boyband in 1996, 4Guys, which Larkin wanted to rival Boyzone. Launched in Wonderbar in April 1996, the line up featured Ken Quinn, Keith Lee, John McGuirke, Mark Power, and Karl Anderson.  In 1996, Larkin was the subject of the radio documentary, By George, made by Kevin Reynolds for RTÉ Radio 1.


== Drag act ==
As Kylie O'Reilly, Larkin was one of the most famous drag queens in Dublin in the 1990s. He hosted nights at a number of Dublin gay bars, including The George. Larkin chose the name Kylie as he was a fan of Kylie Minogue. After the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Ireland in 1993, Larkin dressed as a pregnant Kylie O'Reilly in a wedding dress for Dublin Pride, and at the steps of Central Bank on Dame Street she threw her bouquet into the crowd. Kylie performed with a group called Kylie's Kreatures with fellow drag queens, Maisie Minogue (later known as Phyllis Lautner), Barb Minogue, and Emaciated Minogue at The Temple of Sound.
As Kylie, Larkin wrote, performed and submitted the song Delicious Boyz (Lick Me I’m Delicious) to the Irish National Song Contest for Eurovision.


== Later life ==
Larkin retired from the gay scene in the late 1990s. Larkin died in July 2017.

== Career ==
Aiden began her drag career in the early 2010s while living in Acworth, Georgia. She selected her stage name to represent ""both ends of the spectrum"" as A and Z are the first and last letters of the alphabet. She initially performed mostly at home as a self-described ""bedroom queen"" due to the lack of gay bars in her town. Despite proximity to Atlanta, Zhane experienced difficulty breaking into the city's drag scene early in her career and only occasionally performed there.
Aiden was announced as a cast member on season 12 of RuPaul's Drag Race on January 23, 2020. Zhane was eliminated on the sixth episode of the season, placing ninth in the competition. Along with Brita Filter, she was up for elimination following her performance in the Snatch Game challenge. Zhane's impersonation of Patricia Quinn from The Rocky Horror Picture Show was criticized by the show's judges and Quinn herself. She then lost a lip-sync against Brita to ""Let It Go"" from Frozen. Along with the other season 12 Drag Race contestants, Zhane appeared in Bring Back My Ghouls, a Halloween variety special produced by World of Wonder. Since appearing on Drag Race, Zhane has released three singles.

As well as his entertainment career, Miwa has also written many books, and is known for his outspoken and often highly critical comments on social issues, the government and war, having been in Nagasaki at the time of its bombing in 1945, but having escaped relatively unhurt.
Miwa was against Japan's 2015 Japanese military legislation and Prime Minister Abe's regime, stating that ""Prime Minister Abe and those who voted for the LDP should go to the front as Japanese soldiers firstly."" Miwa is also critical of Japanese militarism in World War II due to the experiences of his childhood. However, Miwa has stated his support for Japanese spiritual and cultural values, emphasising the importance of tenets of Japanese culture such as the Kojiki, the Nihon Shoki, bushido and the spirit of Japanese people, and his support for their restoration in post-war Japan.


== Yoitomake no Uta ==
In 1964, Miwa first released ""Yoitomake no Uta"" (""The Song of the Yoitomake"") after giving a show at a small mining town, due to a mistake by a producer. While he was not entirely willing to perform at first, he was touched at the sight of workers who had come to see him, having bought their tickets with the little wages miners received then. Miwa was ""ashamed and embarrassed of [himself], standing before them in [his] flamboyant clothes"", and also that he did not have a song ""for them"".
This experience inspired him to write ""Yoitomake no Uta"", as well as his rule to not crossdress or wear any of his usual extravagant clothing or make-up when he sang this song, wearing instead the shabby, dark clothes of a post-World War II child and dyeing his literally yellow hair to a more natural black. While the song was a big success – a working song which tells of a mother's love for her child as she works as a ""yoitomake"" (manual laborer), and a child's determination to not let his mother's effort go to waste after being teased for being the child of a ""yoitomake"", based on a story of a childhood friend of Miwa, it was criticised by the then-NAB (National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan) for using several ""discriminating"" words, with ""yoitomake"" being one of them. The song was eventually banned from commercial broadcasting, leading to an outcry among viewers and Miwa himself, stating that it was being judged by one word from the title, and not the content.
After numerous covers were made of the song by artists such as Kyu Sakamoto and Kuwata Keisuke, ""Yoitomake no Uta"" was broadcast nationwide in the 2012 63rd NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen. Miwa appeared in his old, plain showboy-like costume, singing in the dark with only faint pinspot light to avoid the audience from instantly distinguishing his face, as per his request.


== Television and film ==
Although Miwa is better known as a cabaret singer, he has also appeared in a number of films, beginning as a laundry boy in the film Fūryū Kokkei-tan: Sennin Buraku in 1961 under his real name. He also appeared in Shuji Terayama's Aomori-ken no Semushi Otoko in 1967. In 1968 he starred in and composed the theme song for Kinji Fukasaku's Black Lizard, based on Yukio Mishima's stage adaptation of the Edogawa Rampo novel; Mishima also had a cameo in the film as an embalmed corpse. The next year he made another film with Fukasaku, Black Rose Mansion.
In later years he voiced characters in Hayao Miyazaki's internationally successful anime films Princess Mononoke and Howl's Moving Castle, and appeared in Takeshi Kitano's 2005 film Takeshis'. In March 2007, he performed the role of Empress Sisi in the play L'aigle à deux têtes by writer Jean Cocteau at Parco Theatre in Shibuya. In 2009, Miwa voiced the Pokémon Arceus in the film Pokémon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life.
From 2005 to 2010, he co-hosted the successful weekly television program Ōra no izumi (The spring of aura) alongside spiritual counsellor Hiroyuki Ehara and Tokio member Taichi Kokubun. While the show initially aired as late-night program, its popularity bumped it up to a primetime slot in 2007.

173,"Justin Andrew Honard (born March 6, 1985), best known by the stage name Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 or mononymously as Alaska, is an American drag queen and singer from Erie, Pennsylvania. She is best known as the runner-up on the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race and the winner of the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars.
Alaska co-hosts the web series Bro'Laska alongside her brother, Corey Binney. Her first studio album, Anus, was released in 2015, followed by her second album, Poundcake, in 2016, and her third album, Vagina, in 2019. Her fourth album, Red 4 Filth, was released in 2022. Alaska is also a part of The AAA Girls, a drag group with Willam and Courtney Act and hosts the podcast Race Chaser with Willam.


== Early life ==
Honard was born to Andrew and Pam Honard, and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Fort LeBoeuf High School in 2003. Honard has a brother, Cory. He studied theater at the University of Pittsburgh.


== Career ==


=== 2007–2012: Career beginnings ===
After dabbling around in Pittsburgh, Honard eventually moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. After discovering that he disliked the process of trying to land acting jobs, he conceived the concept and personality of her drag persona while smoking marijuana. Honard had previously done drag as a hobby, but the conception of ""Alaska"" fueled an intent to turn it into a career, and she eventually landed a job at the West Hollywood club Fubar. Honard frequently performed as Alaska in the Trannyshack shows in Los Angeles. In 2009, she performed in Palm Springs Gay Pride with Tammie Brown and Jer Ber Jones.
Alaska met future boyfriend Sharon Needles (stage name of Aaron Coady) through Myspace via an introduction from Pittsburgh drag queen Veruca la'Piranha in December 2009, and eventually moved back to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to live with him in 2010. She has said that she found Sharon Needles ""fascinating"", and, even after their breakup, ""still does"". Along with Sharon Needles and Cherri Baum, she formed the band Haus of Haunt, which later evolved into a drag troupe based out of Pittsburgh bar The Blue Moon. As part of the Haus of Haunt, she helped present the Pittsburgh debut of fellow drag queen and recording artist Christeene Vale in 2013. Alaska later impersonated Vale for the music video ""RuPaulogize"" by Willam Belli. The couple had friction between them after Sharon Needles' casting on season four of Drag Race, as Alaska had auditioned for every season of the show previous, and Sharon Needles had been cast on her first attempt at auditioning. Sharon Needles later went on to win the season in April 2012, beating fellow finalists Chad Michaels and Phi Phi O'Hara.


=== 2013–2015: RuPaul's Drag Race and Anus ===

Alaska competed on the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, under the mononym Alaska instead of her full drag name Alaska Thunderfuck. She had previously auditioned for every season of the show, and filmed her audition tape for the fifth season while on a cruise paid for by Sharon Needles' Drag Race winnings. She prepared for the season with the help of Baum, la'Piranha, and New York City-based drag queen Miles De Niro. Sharon Needles was not present for the preparation, as she was touring at the time. Alaska won the fragrance commercial-themed main challenge in the episode ""Scent of a Drag Queen"" and the main challenge for ""Sugar Ball"". As part of the show, Alaska sang on the ""We Are the World""-inspired song ""Can I Get an Amen?"". The song's proceeds helped benefit the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. At the season finale in May 2013, Alaska was declared the runner-up along with fellow competitor Roxxxy Andrews. Jinkx Monsoon was the winner of the season. Due to her substantial gain in wealth after Drag Race and subsequent ability to purchase the item, she later fell into a cocaine addiction, which Alaska has described as ""kinda ugly, gross, and kinda sad"".
In October 2013, Alaska performed as Dr. Frank N. Furter in Woodlawn Theatre's production of The Rocky Horror Show in San Antonio, Texas. RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage and season four contestant Willam Belli also starred in the musical.
Since appearing on RuPaul's Drag Race, Alaska has toured and performed, appearing in RuPaul's Drag Race Battle of the Seasons shows, the Drag Stars at Sea cruises, custom one-woman shows such as a Stevie Nicks tribute called ""Stevie Forever"", a cabaret show called ""Red for Filth"", and a holiday show called ""Blue Christmas"". An animated version of Alaska appeared in the ""RuPaul's Drag Race: Dragopolis 2.0"" mobile app. During the summer of 2014, she starred in a stage production of Sex and the City. With her brother, Cory Binney, Alaska has a web series sponsored by World of Wonder, called Bro'Laska. In 2014, Alaska became a spokesmodel for American Apparel alongside Willam Belli and Courtney Act.
Alaska has since released a string of singles, namely ""Ru Girl"", ""Your Makeup Is Terrible"", and ""Nails"". In June 2015, Alaska's debut album, Anus, was released to positive reviews. Singles from the album included ""Hieeee"" and ""This Is My Hair"".


=== 2016–2017: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars and Poundcake ===
In 2016, Alaska returned to Drag Race for the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. She won 4 challenges (Snatch Game, Acting, Stand Up, Advert) and was in the bottom for a makeover challenge. She received some backlash due to some of her choices of eliminations and her behavior toward the end of the competition. In response, Alaska donated $5,000 to the charity Trans Kids Purple Rainbow and posted an apology video online. In the final five of the competition, when she landed in the bottom, Alaska famously offered competitor Detox $10,000 to vote for her to stay in the competition, of which Alaska revealed years later that she donated the amount to a snake sanctuary instead. In the season finale, she was crowned the second winner of All Stars. Due to the stress sustained while filming the season, she has said that she preferred the experience she had while filming Season 5 of Drag Race over All Stars 2.
In the same year, Alaska released her second album, titled Poundcake. Three singles from the album have been released: ""The T"", ""Stun"", and ""Puppet"". The album is named after the puppet challenge on RuPaul's Drag Race where Alaska and fellow contestant Lineysha Sparx created a rebellious puppet called Lil' Poundcake. On the seventh episode of the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, the main challenge of the episode was for the contestants to act in a true crime spoof entitled ""Forensic Queens: Wha-Ha-Happened to Lil' Poundcake?"", depicting a fictional All Stars season where Lil' Poundcake, slated to make her Drag Race comeback, suddenly disappears.
Alaska competed in the first season of VH1's Scared Famous, which premiered on October 23, 2017, and placed 6th in the competition.


=== 2018–2020: Race Chaser, Vagina, and pageant ===

Since 2018, Alaska has hosted the podcast Race Chaser with fellow Drag Race alumna Willam Belli. The podcast is ""devoted to the discussion and dissection of every episode"" of RuPaul's Drag Race. Alaska and Jeremy Mikush, performing as Alaska and Jeremy, released their debut album Amethyst Journey in 2018.
In 2019, Alaska released her third album titled Vagina. Soon after, she created and hosted The Drag Queen of the Year Pageant Competition Award Contest Competition at the Montalban Theater in Hollywood. The event was sold-out and featured eight different drag artists competing for the crown. The eventual winner, decided by Alaska and a panel of judges including Peppermint, Sharon Needles, and Willam, was Abhora, a former contestant on season two of The Boulet Brothers' Dragula. The event has since been hosted annually by Alaska alongside Lola LeCroix, with a documentary series following the production of the 2022 edition, Behind the Drag Queen of the Year Pageant Competition Award Contest Competition, being released in 2023. In June 2023, a panel of judges from New York magazine placed Alaska seventh on their list of ""the most powerful drag queens in America"", a ranking of 100 former Drag Race contestants.


=== 2021–present: Red 4 Filth and memoir ===
Alaska's first comedy special, The Alaska Thunderfuck Extra Special Comedy Special, aired on OutTV in Canada in 2021.
She released her memoir, My Name's Yours, What's Alaska?: A Memoir on November 9, 2021.
She is one of the most followed queens from Drag Race, and has accumulated over 1.8 million Instagram followers as of October 2021.


== Public image and artistry ==

She has stated, ""I am a huge fan of drag for many reasons; first and foremost being that it is an extremely important form of performance art. Drag uses humor as means of relaying a message, and because humor tends to get overlooked as a valid way to communicate through art, drag tends to get pigeonholed into being something 'less than' when you think about it in terms what you'd see at a museum. I can't think of almost anything more artistically redeeming than a huge museum full of drag queens, but maybe that's just me.""
She has cited Gianni Versace, Lady Gaga and Marc Jacobs as her favorite fashion influences. Thought Catalog described her style as ""risk-taking"" and ""creative"", with ""weird choices""; Yahoo! called her Lil Poundcake outfit a ""pink nightmare"" and ""clownish crazy"", and explained that ""the drag and music world would certainly be very quiet without Ms Thunderfuck"".
Alaska's drag name is derived from Alaskan Thunderfuck, a strain of cannabis. Alaska counts Divine and Marilyn Monroe as her role models.


== Personal life ==
Alaska was in a relationship with fellow drag queen Sharon Needles for four years before separating in November 2013. She has stated that the pair had a drunken physical fight after a night of doing cocaine, and, later that same night, was said to have checked into a hotel with her belongings while wearing a fur coat stained with Sharon Needles' blood. Alaska has since jokingly compared the situation to Angela Bassett as Tina Turner requesting a hotel room in What's Love Got to Do with It. She has also cited her own affair with a man in Florida as a ""symptom"" and ""one of the causes"" of the fight. Alaska was originally angry over the circumstances of their breakup, but, after rekindling their relationship while on tour together, she has said that they are now ""really good friends"". Sharon Needles appeared in Alaska's music video for ""Hieee"" in 2015, two years after their breakup.
In June 2022, Honard's father was killed in a motorcycle crash. Honard wrote on social media that his father was ""kind and loving and hilarious and had a beautiful heart, and had so much love for his family, his wife, my sister and me, and his grandchildren"". He also wrote that he was ""feeling a lot of pain and grief right now. I'm also feeling compassion for anyone who has ever lost someone they love"".

== Early life ==
Justin Dwayne Lee Johnson was born on  January 16, 1980, to Jimmy Harold Johnson and Sherrie Ann Laye in Mesquite, Texas. He was one of seven children in the working-class family, and has described his mother as ""the wind beneath (his) wings"" and his father as ""very, very masculine."" Growing up, Justin's sisters were cheerleaders, and he often found himself wishing he could join in on their practices. Described as a shy and creative child with no interest in sports, he enjoyed watching The Wizard of Oz and dancing and singing tunes such as Rod Stewart’s ""Forever Young"" in his front yard, to the discouragement of his father. Justin was supported by his openly gay Uncle Bobby, who supplied him with a role as an extra in a local production of Brigadoon and financed his enrollment in an all-boys jazz dance class at the Joy Sharp School of Dance in Mesquite, and was only allowed to attend when his father was informed that the son of a local baseball coach attended the class as well. Johnson’s parents divorced around the time he was in high school, when he attended West Mesquite High School and volunteered as an instructor and choreographer for the local peewee drill team. After high school, he attended Ranger College before transferring to the University of North Texas, where he was briefly a part of the college cheer squad and came out as gay. While at UNT, Justin made friends with fellow gay people and was taken to Oak Lawn, a neighborhood in Dallas that is commonly known as Dallas' ""gayborhood"".

The two's history led to many arguments and dramatic moments throughout the season. A ballet challenge win in the fourth episode gave Edwards immunity, saving her from being in the bottom two in the following episode after a negatively received Katy Perry snatch game performance, but RuPaul still asked Edwards to apologize to Perry on Twitter due to the performance. In episode 7, after Edwards performed weakly in a stand-up roast challenge she was placed in the bottom two alongside Roxxxy Andrews, where both would be allowed to stay in the competition after a strong lip-sync to Whip My Hair by Willow Smith. Edwards would fall in the bottom two for a second time in the following episode where she would send home Ivy Winters in a lip sync to Gwen Guthrie's Ain't Nothin' Goin' On but the Rent. Alyssa's time on the season would come to a finish in episode 9, where another poor challenge performance lead to a close lip sync to Paula Abdul's Cold Hearted against rival Coco Montrese, where Montrese emerged victorious and Edwards was eliminated in sixth place.


=== All Stars 2 ===

Due to positive fan reception, in 2016 it was announced that Alyssa Edwards had been cast on the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. The cast included four other queens from season 5, including her season 5 nemesis, Coco Montrese. However, upon Montrese's entrance, it is revealed that the pair had since forgiven each other. A solid performance in the episode 1 talent show meant that Edwards was safe, yet her former enemy was less lucky as Roxxxy Andrews eliminated Montrese first. In episode 3, Edwards's strong performance as Annie Oakley in a ""rusical"" challenge placed her in the top 2 for her first time in the season against Detox, where Edwards would win the lip sync to Taylor Dayne's Tell It to My Heart  and chose to eliminate Ginger Minj over Katya. In the following episode, Edwards was eliminated by Alaska over Roxxxy Andrews and Katya.
In episode 5, eliminated queens were given a chance to re-enter the competition by pairing up with a queen who was still in the game. Edwards was paired with Alaska, and the pair were in the top 2 alongside Detox and the previously eliminated Tatianna. In a lip sync to Rihanna's Shut Up and Drive, both queens were allowed to re-enter the competition and eliminate one of the bottom two. Both chose to eliminate Phi Phi O'Hara. In the seventh episode, Edwards was controversially eliminated by Detox over Andrews and Alaska on the anniversary of her mother's death and one episode before the finale, a move which many saw as unfair as Detox, Alaska, and Andrews had a strong friendship and many thought that Edwards had not deserved to be in the bottom for the episode. Edwards finished in fifth place on All Stars 2.

177,"Darcelle XV (November 16, 1930 – March 23, 2023) was the stage name of Walter Willard Cole, an American drag queen, entertainer, and cabaret owner and operator in Portland, Oregon. Guinness World Records had certified him as the oldest drag queen performer in 2016, with a career as an entertainer spanning 56 years at the time of his death.


== Biography ==
Walter Willard Cole was born on November 16, 1930, and raised in the Linnton neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. He was described as a shy, ""four-eyed sissy boy"". In 1952, he was drafted into the United States Army, where he was stationed in Italy with the Signal Corps, and served for three years. Afterward, he lived a ""conventional"" life in southeast Portland with his wife and two children. He worked at a Fred Meyer store and described himself as having ""a crew cut and horn-rimmed glasses"". Cole used military funds to help start business ventures.  
Cole first purchased a coffeehouse called Caffé Espresso, which later relocated and expanded to include a basement jazz club called Studio A. In 1967, he purchased a tavern in northwest Portland which became Darcelle XV Showplace.
Cole first wore a woman's dress at age 37. By 1969, he had developed the alter ego Darcelle and came out as gay. He left his wife (though they remained legally married) and began a relationship with Roxy Neuhardt, who worked alongside Darcelle at the Showplace as a choreographer, show director, performer, bookkeeper, office manager, and payroll accountant. The two remained together until Neuhardt's death in 2017.
Cole died of natural causes at a hospital in Portland on March 23, 2023, at the age of 92. In one of his final interviews, Darcelle stated on the LGBTQ&A podcast that everything was set up to ensure that his daughter, son, and longtime collaborator, Poison Waters, would be able to keep Darcelle XV Showplace running after his death.


=== Darcelle ===

Cole, who had an interest in acting and had worked at Portland Civic Theater, developed his alter ego Darcelle and came out as gay. The name ""Darcelle"" honors French actress and singer Denise Darcel.
Darcelle wore false eyelashes, jewelry, and shiny clothing. Cole described Darcelle's persona as ""sequins on the eyelids, lots of feathers, big hair, big jewels, and lots of wisecracks"". Avoiding an Oregon law that prohibited the use of more than one instrument during performances, entertainers at Darcelle XV Showplace lip-synched. The business was fined after Neuhardt performed a ""ballet-like adagio"" with another man.
Darcelle attended social functions throughout the city. In 2011, he served as grand marshal of the Portland Rose Festival's Starlight Parade and received the city's Spirit of Portland Award. Cole and Sharon Knorr published his memoir, Just Call Me Darcelle, in 2011. The book recalls Cole's life, including his childhood, military service, and being Darcelle.


== Reception ==
Darcelle XV Showplace has hosted the longest-running drag show on the West Coast. In Kelly Clarke's review of Cole's memoir, she described him as ""an energetic businessman whose desire for a life less ordinary catapulted him from a job at Fred Meyer to become the proprietor of a counterculture coffee shop, an after-hours jazz club, a rough-'n'-ready 'dyke bar' and, finally, a nationally known drag revue, without ever leaving Portland."" Darcelle XV was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest drag queen in 2016, then aged 85 years and 273 days.
In 2023, city officials announced plans to rename O'Bryant Square in memory of Darcelle XV. The new plaza will replace O'Bryant Square. Drawings released in early 2024, show the park will have a stage, public art space, and a wall of fame for notable LGBTQ Portlanders.

181,"Cameron Clayton, better known by the stage name Farrah Moan (born September 11, 1993), is an American drag queen, model, actor, make-up artist and internet personality best known for participating in the 9th season of the reality TV show RuPaul's Drag Race, placing eighth, as well as participating in the 4th season of All Stars, where she placed ninth. Her stage name is a pun on the term ""pheromone"", whilst also being a reference to American actress Farrah Fawcett. In some interviews, she jokingly states that her drag surname is a reference to ""being a whore"".


== Early life ==
Clayton attended Klein High School in Houston, Texas, and was bullied during childhood. Her single-mother household was poor, and she ran away as a teenager, to Austin. Clayton left with a stripper friend, who helped start her career as a drag queen. Prior to starting drag, she was an internet personality on the social-networking website Myspace, under the alias ""Cameron Ugh"".


== Career ==

Farrah Moan's first major performance was as part of a contest entitled ""Austin's Next Drag Superstar"", where she was placed as a runner-up. Whilst working in Austin, fellow Drag Race contestant Cynthia Lee Fontaine was supportive of Clayton, and helped her get booked at local venues. Farrah Moan has said that her biggest inspirations in drag are Christina Aguilera and RuPaul. On February 2, 2017, Logo TV announced that Farrah Moan would participate as a contestant in the ninth season of American reality competition RuPaul's Drag Race. The season premiered on March 24, 2017. Following her poor performance in a roast of the show's judge Michelle Visage, Farrah Moan lost a lip-sync showdown against Alexis Michelle and was eliminated from the competition, placing eighth overall. In a 2023 interview, Farrah Moan noted that immediately prior to arriving on set she had been homeless. She recounted that ""my motivation for staying each episode was to have food and a bed for myself to sleep in"".
Farrah Moan was referenced in the first episode of season ten of Drag Race, with RuPaul misleading the queens into thinking she returned, to reveal Christina Aguilera, one of her idols, instead. Farrah Moan was brought in by the shows producers to meet Aguilera for a Drag Race bonus clip. In September 2018, Farrah Moan performed as a background dancer behind Aguilera for Opening Ceremony's Spring 2019 collection, with other Drag Race alumni.
Farrah Moan photographed with Shea Couleé for Manny MUA's Lunar Beauty palette.
On November 9, 2018, it was announced that Farrah Moan would be one of the contestants competing in the fourth season of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars. After narrowly surviving the first episode's variety show, where she was up for elimination together with Jasmine Masters, Farrah Moan was eliminated by Valentina in the second episode. Farrah Moan returned in episode 6 for a chance to compete again, but lost a lip sync to Valentina, being once again eliminated by her. Farrah Moan placed 9th overall. She appeared as a guest for the first challenge in the premiere of season 11 of Drag Race.
Farrah Moan had a cameo appearance in Men.com's scene Girls Night Part 3.


== Personal life ==
Currently, Clayton resides and works in Los Angeles, California.
In 2018, Clayton and fellow season 9 contestant Shea Couleé were involved in a verbal altercation with a woman at a kebab shop in Newcastle upon Tyne after she began directing homophobic slurs at the pair.
Clayton is a trans woman. In December 2023, during an interview with Maddy Morphosis, she came out as transgender and revealed that she had begun her transition nearly five years prior, in 2019.

182,"Flawless Sabrina (September 10, 1939 – November 18, 2017), also known as Mother Flawless Sabrina, was an American LGBT activist, drag queen, performer, and actress, based in New York City. Flawless Sabrina was a pioneer for transgender people and drag queens not only in the mainstream, heterosexual society, but within the gay society as well, where transgender people remained heavily stigmatized. Sabrina lived in New York near Central Park from the 1960s until her death.


== Early life ==
Born Jack Doroshow in South Philadelphia, in a family of mixed Jewish and Italian heritage, Sabrina was a pioneer in the transgender and gay communities in the 1960s in New York. 
In the 1960s, New York drag queens were very stigmatised, not only by the mainstream society, but even within the gay community as well. Sabrina was one of the first widely known drag queens in the United States. She became widely known partially for organizing various drag queen pageants all over the U.S. such as The Nationals, Miss Philadelphia or the Miss Nationals, which was sponsored by Sabrina Enterprises.


== Career ==
The documentary The Queen captures the 1967 Miss All-America Camp Beauty Contest in New York City; Sabrina served as emcee to the competition. The film was selected to screen during International Critics' Week at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, which was curtailed before any awards could be given out, due to ongoing civil unrest in France.  Sabrina was subsequently arrested three times in 1968 promoting The Queen in Times Square.
While filming the documentary Sabrina took on the moniker of ""Mother"" to assure other participants in the pageant that she was not part of the competition. Very soon, what was a joke became a very personal title, and she became a mentor to numerous other transgender people living in New York City at the time.
The success of The Queen resulted in Sabrina accepting numerous invitations to speak on talk shows and make television appearances in drag. These broadcasts caused discomfort not only with the heterosexual and conservative public, but the gay public as well.  A poster of Sabrina in The Queen has a brief cameo in Pink Flamingos (1972), a film by John Waters. 
Despite Sabrina's confidence with herself in drag on television and other engagements, she remained somewhat mysterious within the gay community, as recounted by Thom Nickels, author of Gay and Lesbian in Philadelphia. Though she was not a huge part of the Center City night life, she hosted several decadent and grandiose mansion parties.
In 2008 Flawless Sabrina appeared in the theatrical production Notorious Beauty in New York City. Sabrina played a drug-induced vision of a thin, ghostly, violin player in Dorian, a 2009 four-channel video installation by Michelle Handelman. Sabrina was also featured in Handelman's 2014 multichannel video installation Irma Vep, The Last Breath, influenced by Musidora, known for playing Irma Vep in the 1915 film Les Vampires.


== Death and legacy ==
Sabrina died on November 18, 2017, at the age of 78.
Sabrina was also a mentor for Ceyenne Doroshow, now an author, public speaker and advocate for homeless youth. They met at a midtown Manhattan club called Bentley's, and Sabrina helped her get control of her life, while she was a homeless teenager.
In 2014, a Kickstarter crowdfunding fundraiser raised $20,000.00 to create an archive of her work for easy access and study, called the ""Flawless Sabrina Archive"". The fundraiser was founded by Zackary Drucker and Diana Tourjee, two of Sabrina's mentees. The archive was created as a thank-you to Sabrina for being inspirational to queer youth, as well as a way of raising money to protect her when she was almost evicted from her New York City apartment. The owner of the building had died, and once the ownership was returned to the bank they wished to increase the rent, or evict her. The archive money now funds a storage space where Tourjee archives Sabrina's possessions as they move them in. Sabrina's mentees also state, as part of their reason for the creation of the Flawless Sabrina Archives, that Sabrina has been and continues to be an influential part of the transgender community.
In 2021, PBS television series American Masters published a 6-minute documentary short, Flawless Sabrina: Queer Icon and Star of ""The Queen', narrated by Peppermint.

Sanchez co-created, co-wrote, and stars in Les Voyages de Nicky, a documentary that explores gender expression, the art of drag, and LGBT activism in different countries.


== Early life ==
Sanchez was born on March 14, 1991, in Marseille, France, but also travelled quite a bit as a child, living in St. Martin and Morocco. His mother is Spanish.


== Career ==
Sanchez trained to be a make-up artist. He created his drag persona in 2009 and has modeled extensively as Nicky Doll, appearing on the pages of Féroce Magazine, Cosmopolitan and Volition Magazine among others. Sanchez developed his drag persona by himself. He does not have a drag mother, nor does he belong to any drag family. The name Nicky Doll is a tribute to Nicki Minaj and is meant to evoke versatility and reflect the different personalities Sanchez's drag persona exhibits. Sanchez self-describes Nicky Doll as a 90's life-size doll.
Nicky Doll's participation on season 12 of RuPaul’s Drag Race was announced on January 23, 2020. She is the first French contestant on the US version of the show. She was described as a ‘look queen’ and has spoken openly about “deep insecurities when it comes to the language barrier” that she experienced during the show. She made attempts to change that impression by applying silly makeup and hamming it up as the baby in the Gay’s Anatomy acting challenge.
Ultimately, it wasn't enough and Nicky Doll was eliminated at the end of episode 5, and placed eleventh overall. During her time on the show, Nicky Doll was in the top once, and in the bottom two times. She successfully lip-synced ""for his life"" against Dahlia Sin in episode 3, to Problem by Ariana Grande featuring Iggy Azalea. In episode 5, she was unsuccessful in his performance against Heidi N Closet to the song ""Heart to Break"" by Kim Petras. As a result of his appearance on Drag Race, Nicky Doll was hand-picked by RuPaul to do Pete Davidson's makeup for a pre-recorded sketch on an episode of Saturday Night Live which was hosted by RuPaul.
In March 2022, Nicky Doll was announced as the host of Drag Race France. The first season of Drag Race France premiered on June 25, 2022. Nicky Doll will provide commentary for the French broadcast of the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 semi-finals on Culturebox.

Brown entered the Werkroom in a mouse look made of paper with the entrance line, ""I'm Nina, Bo'nina, Banana, Fofana, Osama Bin Laden Brown! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!"" She was the winner of the premiere episode's challenge (Miss Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve and Talent), guest judged by Lady Gaga.
In episode five, Brown voiced her frustrations on not being cast as model Blac Chyna for the Rusical challenge. She named her 2018 tour ""I Shoulda Been Blac Chyna"" after this moment. Drag Race alumni Alaska also referenced this moment in a line of her song ""Valentina"".
Brown placed in the bottom two three times, eliminating Aja and Valentina. She was eliminated on the makeover challenge episode after losing a lip sync of ""Cool for the Summer"" by Demi Lovato against Shea Couleé.

== Personal life ==
Dease is openly gay. Prior to filming season nine of Drag Race, he relocated to Atlanta, Georgia.
In RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked, Dease stated that his audition for season nine was going to be his final attempt. According to Dease, being rejected from seasons five through eight played a role in his depression and anxiety.


== Controversies ==
In 2017, Nina Bo’nina Brown received backlash for sending fan favorite Valentina home in a lipsync for your life on the 9th episode of the ninth season of RuPaul's Drag Race. The elimination went down as one of the shows most controversial lipsyncs and placed in Gay Times Top 10 Most Controversial RuPaul's Drag Race Eliminations.
In 2021, Nina Bo’nina Brown was accused of making transphobic comments about Gottmik, a contestant on the thirteenth season of RuPaul's Drag Race; Kade Gottlieb (aka Gottmik) is a transgender male. Brown's joke about Gottmik's hips prompted criticism from several RuPaul’s Drag Race contestants, with many stars defending Gottmik, including Yvie Oddly, Jackie Cox, Denali, Kameron Michaels, and Jan Sport, as well as Bimini Bon-Boulash, Joe Black, Cheryl Hole, and Crystal from RuPaul's Drag Race UK. Brown claimed that the criticism was unwarranted and denied accusations of transphobia.

187,"Phabullo Rodrigues da Silva (born 1 November 1993), known professionally as Pabllo Vittar (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpablu viˈtaʁ]), is a Brazilian drag queen and singer.


== Life and career ==


=== 1993–2016: Early life ===
Born in São Luís, Phabullo is a fraternal  twin and has an older sister. He spent part of his childhood and adolescence living in the cities of Santa Inês and Caxias, both in the interior of Maranhão, due to financial difficulties. He never knew his father, who abandoned his mother, a nurse, when she was pregnant with him.
During his childhood, Phabullo experienced bullying because of his delicate gestures and feminine voice. He was physically assaulted with a plate of hot soup strewn over his face. He attended ballet classes during this period.
At the age of 13, Phabullo began doing covers at family parties and school performances and joined a choir at a Catholic church. Soon after, he began songwriting. Later, he decided to become a professional, moving to Indaiatuba with his sister, where he worked in several places, such as snack bars and beauty salons. Soon after, he moved to Uberlândia with his mother, who had recently married. At the age of 15, he came out to his mother, who had suspected that he was gay; his sister already knew about his sexual orientation. His mother, whom he talks to daily, is supportive of his sexual orientation.

He then began to go out for the night in Maranhão, to make friends, and to participate as one of a selection of singers in a house of shows. He started performing his own songs and impersonating celebrities for a small fee, but it was not a professional job. He was now dressing feminine, but did not identify himself as a drag queen; the first time that he did drag was at age 17 in Uberlândia, to publicize a party of his friend by delivering pamphlets at the door of a nightclub. With time, he started performing in LGBT parades in several cities of Maranhão and became known by the state's LGBT community. At age 18, in Minas Gerais, Phabullo started participating in and winning some beauty contests in full drag, before beginning his professional career as a singer while adopting the stage name of ""Pabllo Knowles"", an homage to singer Beyoncé. His first performance as a drag queen occurred at the Belgrano nightclub, of producers Ian Hayashi and Leocádio Rezende (whom Phabullo would later call his ""parents"").
Still in Minas Gerais, Phabullo took a university entrance exam by the Federal University of Uberlândia, where he was admitted to the full design course in 2013, but after some periods he dropped out of college due to his schedule of shows, which increased greatly due to the success of his music videos on the internet and his participation in the band of primetime television program Amor & Sexo.
When he attracted attention from entrepreneurs in the entertainment field, Phabullo began his musical career professionally, performing in bars and concert halls in Uberlândia and cities of the region. In this period, Phabullo adopted the stage name of Pabllo Vittar.
Vittar appeared on TV for the first time in 2014, on a Brazilian talent singing show, performing ""I Have Nothing"" by Whitney Houston. He became famous in the media in 2015 with the success of his music video ""Open Bar"", a Portuguese-language version of Major Lazer's song ""Lean On"" with original lyrics, produced by Bonde do Rolê and Omulu. In less than four months, the video reached one million views on YouTube. He also released an extended play with the same name, using pop hits' instrumentals with new arrangements and lyrics.


=== 2017: Vai Passar Mal ===
On 12 January 2017, his debut studio album Vai Passar Mal was released – including the singles ""Nêga"", ""Todo Dia"", ""K.O."", ""Corpo Sensual"", ""Então Vai"" (with Diplo) and ""Indestrutível"". In the same month he released ""Todo Dia"" as the second single of the album, which became notorious at Brazilian Carnival due to its lyrics. The third single ""K.O."" became an even bigger hit and brought Vittar to nationwide fame and success; as of 2021, the song has over 381 million views on YouTube. The fourth single, ""Corpo Sensual"", was released on 6 September 2017, to similar success, resulting in over 321 million views on YouTube.
Vittar has been featured in songs by international artists such as Major Lazer's ""Sua Cara"" (with fellow Brazilian singer Anitta). The music video was released on 30 July 2017, and reached 10th place on the list of most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours, with 25 million views. The singer also appears on ""I Got It"", from Charli XCX's fourth mixtape Pop 2. Vittar collaborated again with XCX on ""Flash Pose"", released on 25 July 2019; the single was later included on Vittar's album 111. He also got to perform ""Flash Pose"" at the 2019 MTV Europe Music Awards.


=== 2018: Não Para Não ===

On 15 August 2018, Pabllo Vittar released his second studio album Não Para Não – including the singles ""Problema Seu"", ""Disk Me"", ""Seu Crime"", ""Buzina"", and ""Não Vou Deitar"". Vittar toured in support of the album, in Brazil and internationally. An extended tour called NPN Pride saw Vittar performing in various pride parades throughout the United States and Canada. The first two singles were released to great success, with ""Disk Me"" reaching over 85 million views and ""Problema Seu"" reaching over 112 million views on YouTube. The singles ""Seu Crime"" and ""Buzina"" also were successful, albeit with smaller numbers, with both reaching over 25 million views on YouTube. This album also featured Brazilian singers Dilsinho and Ludmilla in ""Trago seu Amor de Volta"" and ""Vai Embora"", respectively.


=== 2019–2020: 111 ===
On 31 October 2019, Pabllo Vittar released the 111 1 EP – including the singles ""Parabéns"" (with Brazilian rapper Psirico), ""Amor de Que"" and ""Flash Pose"" (with Charli XCX). Following the success of the 111 1 EP, ""Amor de Que"" rose to success thanks to the 2020 Brazilian Carnival, with the song reaching over 50 million views in just a month; as of 2021, the song has over 138 million views. ""Parabéns"" was released as the second single and also enjoyed similar success, with over 127 million views on YouTube as of 2020. ""Flash Pose"" had modest success, reaching over 25 million views on YouTube.
On 24 March 2020, Vittar's third studio album 111 was released – including the singles ""Clima Quente"" (with Brazilian Jerry Smith), ""Tímida"" (with Thalía) and ""Rajadão""; the songs from the EP were also included in the album. Vittar collaborated with various artists on the album, and included songs in Portuguese, English and Spanish.
With the nomination of ""Sua Cara"" at the 19th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, Vittar became the first Grammy-nominated drag queen. He also became the first drag queen to win an EMA award in its 25-year run for Best Brazilian Act. The following year, he consecutively won again.


== Artistry ==


=== Musical and vocal style ===
Vittar is mainly a pop singer, although his music incorporates other genres. His debut studio album Vai Passar Mal mixes pop with elements of electronic music and Brazilian genres such as tecno brega, arrocha, funk carioca, and forró. Music critics noted that his second studio album Não Para Não follows a similar formula, mixing Brazilian and international influences. Speaking about the latter album, Vittar explained: ""I lived in Santa Izabel do Pará and listened to cumbia, carimbó, tecnobrega and guitarrada. In Maranhão, I heard axé and Bahia pagode... Pabllo Vittar is all over this album, I cannot go against my origins."" His lyrics often explore themes such as love, self-confidence, and partying.
Vittar is a countertenor with 2.3 octaves of vocal extension already exhibited, spanning from flat E in the third octave (E♭3) to G# in the fifth octave (G♯5). Sérgio Anders, a singing professor at the State University of Minas Gerais, considers Vittar to have ""an infantile voice in an adult male"". While he views Vittar as a good singer, Anders opines that his technique is not very developed. Shannon Sims of The New York Times described Vittar's voice as a ""nasal soprano"".


=== Influences ===

Vittar grew up listening to artists such as Aretha Franklin, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston, and Tina Turner, whom he imitated as a child before he even considered becoming a drag queen, as well as Gilberto Gil, Ney Matogrosso, Elis Regina, Alcione Nazareth, and Caetano Veloso. He became interested in drag after watching the reality show RuPaul's Drag Race and cited RuPaul as an important inspiration: ""All the drag artists in this world have to thank RuPaul for the visibility we have today."" Some participants of the show have also influenced Vittar, notably April Carrion and Naomi Smalls. Model Bella Hadid visually influences him, especially his makeup and style. His music and performances are greatly influenced by bands such as Banda Batidão and Companhia do Calypso.
Early in his career, he used the stage name Pabllo Knowles as a reference to Beyoncé. Other influences include Rihanna, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, and Britney Spears, as well as his ""Sua Cara"" collaborators Anitta and Major Lazer. While making his debut album Vai Passar Mal, Vittar explained that he listened to several artists to find inspiration, citing Liniker and Elza Soares as examples. The album was also influenced by Lana Del Rey, Allie X, Rihanna's album Anti, and Beyoncé's album Lemonade.


== Public image and impact ==
 Vittar's music is considered as ""unofficial anthems for Brazil's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community"" and he is widely viewed as a voice for them. Because dangers to LGBTQ+ people have grown in Brazil, Vittar's openness about being gay has made him an icon to those living in a prejudiced environment. As an openly gay Brazilian drag queen, Vittar has served as a positive representation of homosexuality and gender fluidity. He used his visibility to support LGBTQ+ individuals in Brazil and in other countries in South America. He said: ""They tell me a lot about their daily struggle to go out on the street being gay, being drag. I want to give them strength so they can continue being who they are."" Vittar also appeared on A Força do Querer (""Edge of Desire""), a popular telenovela about a transgender man. After seeing Vittar perform at the Rock in Rio festival, actor Fábio Assunção wrote in a Facebook post: ""You represent the possibility of truth in a sea of hypocrisy. Your public figure is the voice of many suffocated people.""
In an interview for Veja magazine, Vittar revealed that he chose a masculine stage name because he wanted to be truthful to the public, since he is not transgender. He only acts as a woman when he's on stage as Pabllo Vittar and has a more typical masculine gender expression in his private life. During the same interview, Vittar said he is ""making music for humans."" In October 2022 Vittar came out as gender-fluid on the PodPah podcast.
Since his debut, Vittar became the most followed and most streamed drag queen in the world, surpassing RuPaul. In 2020, Vittar was featured in a campaign for Calvin Klein, as part of the designer's pride collection.
On 4 May 2024, Vittar performed with Madonna during her The Celebration Tour on Copacabana Beach, in Rio de Janeiro in front of 1.6 million concert attendees. Vittar joined Madonna on stage during a samba remix of her hit song ""Music"".

188,"Pandora's box is an artifact in Greek mythology connected with the myth of Pandora in Hesiod's c. 700 B.C. poem Works and Days. Hesiod related that curiosity led her to open a container left in the care of her husband, thus releasing curses upon mankind. Later depictions of the story have been varied, with some literary and artistic treatments focusing more on the contents than on Pandora herself.
The container mentioned in the original account was actually a large storage jar, but the word was later mistranslated. In modern times an idiom has grown from the story meaning ""Any source of great and unexpected troubles"", or alternatively ""A present which seems valuable but which in reality is a curse"".


== In mythology ==

According to Hesiod, when Prometheus stole fire from heaven, Zeus, the king of the gods, took vengeance by presenting Pandora to Prometheus' brother Epimetheus. Pandora opened a jar left in her care containing sickness, death and many other unspecified evils which were then released into the world. Though she hastened to close the container, only one thing was left behind – usually translated as Hope, though it could also have the pessimistic meaning of ""deceptive expectation"".
From this story has grown the idiom ""to open a Pandora's box"", meaning to do or start something that will cause many unforeseen problems. A modern, more colloquial equivalent is ""to open a can of worms"". Pandora's box is a metaphor for something that brings about great troubles or misfortune, but also holds hope. In Greek mythology, Pandora's box was a gift from the gods to Pandora, the first woman on Earth. It contained all the evils of the world, which were released when Pandora opened the box. However, it also contained hope, which remained inside the box. Symbolically, the box represents the curiosity and desire for knowledge that can lead to both negative consequences and positive outcomes. The evils inside the box can be seen as the challenges and difficulties of life, while the hope represents the optimism and resilience to overcome those challenges.


== Etymology of the ""box"" ==
The word translated as ""box"" was actually a large jar (πίθος pithos) in Greek. Pithoi were used for storage of wine, oil, grain or other provisions, or, ritually, as a container for a human body for burying, from which it was believed souls escaped and necessarily returned. Many scholars see a close analogy between Pandora herself, who was made from clay, and the clay jar which dispenses evils.
The mistranslation of pithos is usually attributed to the 16th-century humanist Erasmus who, in his Latin account of the story of Pandora, changed the Greek pithos to pyxis, meaning ""box"". The context in which the story appeared was Erasmus' collection of proverbs, the Adagia (1508), in illustration of the Latin saying Malo accepto stultus sapit (from experiencing trouble a fool is made wise). In his version the box is opened by Epimetheus, whose name means 'Afterthought' – or as Hesiod comments, ""he whom mistakes made wise"".

== Contents ==
There were alternative accounts of jars or urns containing blessings and evils bestowed upon humanity in Greek myth, of which a very early account is related in Homer's Iliad:

On the floor of Jove's palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.
In a major departure from Hesiod, the 6th-century BC Greek elegiac poet Theognis of Megara states that 

The poem seems to hint at a myth in which the jar contained blessings rather than evils. It is confirmed in the new era by an Aesopic fable recorded by Babrius, in which the gods send the jar containing blessings to humans. Rather than a named female, it was a generic ""foolish man"" (ἀκρατὴς ἄνθρωπος) who opened the jar out of curiosity and let them escape. Once the lid was replaced, only hope remained, ""promising that she will bestow on each of us the good things that have gone away."" This aetiological version is numbered 312 in the Perry Index.
In the Renaissance, the story of the jar was revisited by two immensely influential writers, Andrea Alciato in his Emblemata (1534) and the Neo-Latin poet Gabriele Faerno in his collection of a hundred fables (Fabulum Centum, 1563). Alciato only alluded to the story while depicting the goddess Hope seated on a jar in which, she declares, ""I alone stayed behind at home when evils fluttered all around, as the revered muse of the old poet [Hesiod] has told you"". Faerno's short poem also addressed the origin of hope but in this case it is the remainder of the ""universal blessings"" (bona universa) that have escaped: ""Of all good things that mortals lack,/Hope in the soul alone stays back.""
An idea of the nature of the blessings lost is given in a Renaissance engraving by Giulio Bonasone, where the culprit is Pandora's husband, Epimetheus. He is shown holding the lid of a large storage jar from which female representations of the Roman virtues are flying up into the air. They are identified by their names in Latin: security (salus), harmony (concordia), fairness (aequitas), mercy (clementia), freedom (libertas), happiness (felicitas), peace (pax), worth (virtus) and joy (laetitia). Hope (spes) is delayed on the lip and holds aloft the flower that is her attribute.


== Difficulties of interpretation ==
In Hesiodic scholarship, the interpretive crux has endured: Is the hope imprisoned within a jar full of evils to be considered a benefit for humanity, or a further curse? A number of mythology textbooks echo the sentiments of M. L. West: ""[Hope's retention in the jar] is comforting, and we are to be thankful for this antidote to our present ills."" Some scholars such as Mark Griffith, however, take the opposite view: ""[Hope] seems to be a blessing withheld from men so that their life should be the more dreary and depressing."" The interpretation hangs on two related questions: First, how is elpis to be rendered, the Greek word usually translated as ""hope""? Second, does the jar preserve elpis for people, or keep it away from them?
As with most ancient Greek words, elpis can be translated in a number of ways. A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of ""expectation"". Classical authors use the word elpis to mean ""expectation of bad"", as well as ""expectation of good"". Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of extant ancient Greek literature. Others hold the minority view that elpis should be rendered ""expectation of evil"" (vel sim).
The answer to the first question largely depends on the answer to the second one: should the jar be interpreted as a prison, or a pantry? The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released – they only affect humanity once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for elpis as well, withholding it from the human race. If elpis means expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, hope, remains locked securely inside. A less pessimistic interpretation understands the myth to say: countless evils fled Pandora's jar and plague human existence; the hope that humanity might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar. Life is not hopeless, but human beings are hopelessly human.
It is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar, the false kind of hope, and was no good for humanity, since, later in the poem, Hesiod writes that hope is empty (498) and no good (500) and makes humanity lazy by taking away their industriousness, making them prone to evil.
In Human, All Too Human, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that ""Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.""
An objection to the ""hope is good/the jar is a prison"" interpretation counters that, if the jar is full of evils, then what is expectant hope – a blessing – doing among them? This objection leads some to render elpis as the expectation of evil, which would make the myth's tone somewhat optimistic: although mankind is troubled by all the evils in the world, at least it is spared the continual expectation of evil, which would make life unbearable.
The optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M. L. West. Elpis takes the more common meaning of expectant hope. And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped, it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope. West explains, ""It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one."" Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans.


== Fixing the blame ==
Neither Alciato nor Faerno had named who was responsible for opening the jar beyond saying it was a ""mortal"". During the Renaissance it is the name of Epimetheus that is mentioned as often as not, as in the engraving by Bonasone noticed above and the mention of Pandora's partner in a rondeau that Isaac de Benserade took it on himself to insert into his light-hearted version of the Metamorphoses (1676) - although Ovid had not in fact written about it himself.

The etching by Sébastien Le Clerc that accompanied the poem in the book shows Pandora and Epimetheus seated on either side of a jar from which clouds of smoke emerge, carrying up the escaping evils. The lid of the jar is quite plainly in Epimetheus' hand. Paolo Farinati, an earlier Venetian artist, was also responsible for a print which laid the blame on Epimetheus, depicting him as lifting the lid from the jar that Pandora is holding. Out of it boils a cloud which carries up a man and a dragon; between them they support a scroll reading ""sero nimirum sapere caepit"" (finding out too late), in reference to the meaning of Epimetheus' name in Greek.

Another Venetian print, ascribed to Marco Angelo del Moro (active 1565 – 1586), is much more enigmatic. Usually titled ""Pandora's Box, or The Sciences that Illuminate the Human Spirit"", it portrays a woman in antique dress opening an ornate coffer from which spill books, manuscripts, snakes and bats. By Pandora's side is a woman carrying a burning brand, while a horned figure flees in the opposite direction. Above is a curved vault painted with signs of the zodiac to which the sun-god Apollo is pointing, while opposite him another figure falls through the stars. Commentators ascribe different meanings to these symbols as contradictory as the contents of the chest. In one reading, the hand Pandora holds up to her face makes her the figure of Ignorance. Alternatively her eyes are protected because she is dazzled and the snakes crawling from the chest are ancient symbols of wisdom. Apollo, seated above, points to Aquarius, the zodiacal sign of January/February, which marks the ""Ascent of the Sun"" from the trough of winter. The falling figure opposite him may be identified either as Lucifer or as night fleeing before the dawn; in either case, the darkness of ignorance is about to be dispelled. The question remains whether the box thus opened will in the end be recognised as a blessing; whether the ambiguous nature of knowledge is either to help or to hurt.
In later centuries the emphasis in art has generally been on the person of Pandora. With few exceptions, the box has appeared merely as her attribute. René Magritte's street scene of 1951, however, one of the few modern paintings to carry the title ""Pandora's Box"", is as enigmatic as were the Renaissance allegorical prints.


== Theatre ==
In the first half of the 18th-century, three French plays were produced with the title ""Pandora's Box"" (La Boîte – or Boëte – de Pandore). In each of these, the main interest is in the social and human effects of the evils released from the box and in only one of them does Pandora figure as a character. The 1721 play by Alain René Lesage appeared as part of the longer La Fausse Foire. It was a one-act prose drama of 24 scenes in the commedia dell'arte style. At its opening, Mercury has been sent in the guise of Harlequin to check whether the box given by Jupiter to the animated statue Pandora has been opened. He proceeds to stir up disruption in her formerly happy village, unleashing ambition, competition, greed, envy, jealousy, hatred, injustice, treachery and ill-health. Amid the social breakdown, Pierrot falls out with the bride he was about to marry at the start of the play and she becomes engaged instead to a social upstart.
The play by Philippe Poisson (1682–1743) was a one-act verse comedy first produced in 1729. There Mercury visits the realm of Pluto to interview the ills shortly to be unleashed on mankind. The characters Old Age, Migraine, Destitution, Hatred, Envy, Paralysis, Quinsy, Fever and Transport (emotional instability) report their effects to him. They are preceded by Love, who argues that he deserves to figure among them as a bringer of social disruption. The later play of 1743 was written by Pierre Brumoy and subtitled ""curiosity punished"" (la curiosité punie). The three-act satirical verse comedy is set in the home of Epimetheus and the six children recently created by Prometheus. Mercury comes on a visit, bringing the fatal box with him. In it are the evils soon to subvert the innocence of the new creations. Firstly seven flatterers: the Genius of Honours, of Pleasures, Riches, Gaming (pack of cards in hand), Taste, Fashion (dressed as Harlequin) and False Knowledge. These are followed by seven bringers of evil: envy, remorse, avarice, poverty, scorn, ignorance and inconstancy. The corrupted children are rejected by Prometheus but Hope arrives at the end to bring a reconciliation.
It is evident from these plays that, in France at least, blame had shifted from Pandora to the trickster god who contrives and enjoys mankind's subversion. Although physical ills are among the plagues that visit humanity, greater emphasis is given to the disruptive passions which destroy the possibility of harmonious living.


== Poetry ==

Two poems in English dealing with Pandora's opening of the box are in the form of monologues, although Frank Sayers preferred the term monodrama for his recitation with lyrical interludes, written in 1790. In this Pandora is descending from Heaven after being endowed with gifts by the gods and therefore feels empowered to open the casket she carries, releasing strife, care, pride, hatred and despair. Only the voice of Hope is left to comfort her at the end. In the poem by Samuel Phelps Leland (1839–1910), Pandora has already arrived in the household of Epimetheus and feels equally confident that she is privileged to satisfy her curiosity, but with a worse result. Shutting the lid too early, she thus ""let loose all curses on mankind/ Without a hope to mitigate their pain"". This is the dilemma expressed in the sonnet that Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote to accompany his oil painting of 1869–71. The gifts with which Pandora has been endowed and that made her desirable are ultimately subverted, ""the good things turned to ill…Nor canst thou know/ If Hope still pent there be alive or dead."" In his painting Rossetti underlines the point as a fiery halo streams upward from the opening casket on which is inscribed the motto NESCITUR IGNESCITUR (unknown it burns).
While the speakers of the verse monologues are characters hurt by their own simplicity, Rossetti's painting of the red-robed Pandora, with her expressive gaze and elongated hands about the jewelled casket, is a more ambiguous figure. So too is the girl in Lawrence Alma-Tadema's watercolour of Pandora (see above), as the comments of some of its interpreters indicate. Sideways against a seascape, red-haired and naked, she gazes down at the urn lifted towards her ""with a look of animal curiosity"", according to one contemporary reviewer, or else ""lost in contemplation of some treasure from the deep"" according to another account. A moulded sphinx on the unopened lid of the urn is turned in her direction. In the iconography of the time, such a figure is usually associated with the femme fatale, but in this case, the crown of hyacinths about her head identifies Pandora as an innocent Greek maiden. Nevertheless, the presence of the sphinx at which she gazes with such curiosity suggests a personality on the cusp, on the verge of gaining some harmful knowledge that will henceforth negate her uncomplicated qualities. The name of Pandora already tells her future.

189,"Panties are women's underwear. Panties can be form-fitting or loose. Typical components include an elastic waistband, a crotch panel to cover the genitalia (usually lined with absorbent material such as cotton), and a pair of leg openings that, like the waistband, are often made of elastomer. Various materials are used, but are usually chosen to be breathable.
Panties are made of a variety of materials, including cotton, lace, latex, leather, lycra, mesh, nylon, PVC, polyester, rawhide, satin, and silk. Construction typically consists of two pieces (front and rear) that are joined by seams at the crotch and sides; an additional gusset is often in the crotch, with the waistband and leg-openings made from elastomer.


== History ==
The earliest known use of underwear that resembles modern panties dates back to 4,400 B.C. during the Badari period in Egypt.


== Terminology ==
In the United Kingdom and occasionally in other Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand, panties may be referred to as ""knickers"", ""undies"", or simply ""underwear"". The last two of these are gender-neutral terms and can be used for either male or female styles of underwear bottom, the American English equivalent being underpants. In Australia, male underpants are often referred to as ""undies"", although the word can also refer to panties.


== Styles ==

Panties are classified into various styles based on criteria such as the amount of rear coverage, width at the sides and height at which they are worn. These categories are not necessarily distinct and usage may vary somewhat among brands:

Adhesive panties are sometimes described as strapless/stick-on panties. They are a form of micro-panties that cover the bare minimum parts on the front and back. They are useful when women do not want the panty line to be visible.
Bikinis, like hipsters, sit at hip level, but the fabric of the side sections is narrower. With the string bikini type, the side sections disappear altogether and the waistband consists of only string-like material. There may be less rear coverage with the bikini style.
Boyshorts cover the hips and are named for their similarity to boxer briefs, a variation on boxer shorts. Some resemble men's briefs, complete with fly and contrast trim. Unlike men's briefs, this style is usually lower cut. Boyshorts often cover most of the buttocks.
Briefs rise to the waist, or just below the navel, and have full coverage in the rear.
Classic briefs have the waistband sitting very high on the waist. The leg holes are small so the underwear cover as much area between waist and thigh as possible. Sometimes called ""granny panties"" because they were the standard underpants in previous decades and have a connotation of being worn by older women.
Control briefs are designed to offer support while giving a slimmer appearance. This type usually contains a stretch material such as spandex and may extend above the waist. Some have an extra firm panel to flatten the tummy. Some also compress the buttocks, while other control briefs are designed to avoid compression of the buttocks. Others merely lift the buttocks and have holes cut out for maximum fullness of the buttocks.
High-cut briefs sit higher on the waist, providing more coverage in the midriff region. They are designed with larger leg holes and narrower sides to show off more leg and allow more freedom of movement.
Cheekies can be styled as a hipster, bikini, or boyshort in the front, but in the rear, they are designed to hug the buttocks, and have a seam or ruching to make the fabric sit partially between the cheeks to accentuate the shape. They leave the outer 1/3 to 1/2 of each cheek exposed and often have a lace or scalloped trim.
Hipsters are a blend between bikinis and boyshorts. They sit on the hips of the wearer and are worn slightly below the navel.
Tangas provide a moderate to minimal coverage with back coverage that is less than a bikini, and the waistband is reduced to a narrow strip at the sides.
The G-string has a vertical string at the back, which connects the crotch to the waistband, sometimes featuring a triangle of fabric which is sometimes referred to as a whale tail when it peeks out above the waistband of low riding pants.
The T-front is a type of G-string in which the string also reaches the front part. It provides almost no coverage while still maintaining the basic hygienic underwear functions and covering only the genitalia. Usually it is built by strings only, sometimes with more fabric or lace around the waist.
Thongs have a waistband similar to tangas, but the rear coverage is mostly cut away. The crotch is triangle-shaped, as it narrows to a thin strip toward the back and sits between the buttocks, becoming wider towards the top where it connects to the waistband. Like the G-string, if the back fabric peeks out above the waistband of low riding pants, the result is also called a whale tail.

193,"Heidi N Closet is the stage name of Trevien Anthonie Cheek, an American drag queen from Ramseur, North Carolina, best known for competing on the twelfth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, where she placed 6th and won the Miss Congeniality award. She returned to the eighth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, but decided to quit the competition early, citing her mental health and wellbeing as the reason for her withdrawal.


== Early life ==
Cheek was raised in Ramseur, North Carolina. His mother died at a young age, and he is estranged from his father. He was raised by his grandmother.


== Career ==
In 2014, shortly after turning 18, Cheek's sister invited him to a drag show in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Cheek has said of seeing his first drag show, ""I saw the glamour of being able to do whatever you want to do."" Cheek said his drag name ""came from a joke. It started out as a lot of men from my hometown are closeted and they would always try and get my goodies and whatnotries. I was like, 'There's no need to be hiding in the closet.'""
Cheek's participation as a cast member on season 12 of RuPaul’s Drag Race was announced on January 23, 2020. He is the third contestant on the show from North Carolina, following Victoria ""Porkchop"" Parker (Season 1) and Stacy Layne Matthews (Season 3), and had not previously auditioned for the show. Heidi experienced an allergic reaction on her first day of shooting, but finished safe. During the competition, RuPaul expressed disapproval with her name choice, stating during episode 10: ""I don't know if you've heard the story, but she came here as Heidi N Closet. Rotten!"" With each episode RuPaul refers to Heidi by different names, including Heidi Ho, Heidi N Seeky, Heidi Hydrates, and Heidi Afrodite. Despite this, Heidi revealed during the Season 12 reunion episode that she had decided to keep her name.

Heidi was dubbed the ""heart"" of the season by Out. During the competition, she placed in the top three times, winning one challenge. She also placed in the bottom two on four occasions. Her first two times in the bottom she survived the lip sync, sending home Nicky Doll and Brita respectively. Her third time in the bottom she lip-synced against Jackie Cox, and both were saved by RuPaul in a double shantay. She was eliminated in the eleventh episode, placing 6th overall in the competition, after losing her fourth lip sync to eventual winner of the season Jaida Essence Hall. During the season finale, she was named Miss Congeniality as voted on by her peers.
Cheek has experienced extreme poverty in his life and career, having indicated that he made $9,000 the year before competing on Ru Paul's Drag Race, while working at a gas station. When talking on her show Gap Chat, Heidi said, ""When I went to Drag Race, I actually had only 33 cents in my bank account the day I showed up [...] Even to just pay for the suitcases to get there was stressful."" Many queens join the show hoping that experience will pay out for them, but they first need to have a significant amount of money upfront to pay for their looks. Cheek borrowed money from his boyfriend and friends for materials, then sewed all his looks with his drag sisters. The quality of the looks came up during the season during various moments but the different financial starting points were never openly acknowledged. The show does not give any financial support to participants, they must all come with their costumes and are only compensated a few hundred dollars an episode. Heidi recounted the experience, ""I’m sitting up here spending between $4,000 and $5,000 on everything. Whereas some girls spent 20, 30, 40, even $50,000 on garments [...] Yeah, my garments just aren’t gonna stand up to their outfits. It’s just not gonna happen.”
Heidi N Closet competed on the eighth season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (2023). She decided to quit the competition early, self-eliminating in Episode 5 of the series.
In 2024 Heidi N Closet starred as Robin Banks in the Tubi horror comedy film Slay, alongside fellow Drag Race alumni Cara Melle, Crystal Methyd and Trinity the Tuck.


=== Music ===
In February 2021, she released a music video for her first single, G.A.P, a parody of ""WAP"", featuring fellow RuPaul's Drag Race season twelve alum Widow Von'Du. In 2021, Cheek was featured in Tiger Queens: The Tiger King Musical, a TikTok musical parody of Tiger King, starring as the tiger.

194,"Jackie Cox is the stage name of Darius Rose (born April 10, 1985), a Canadian drag queen based in New York City, known for being a competitor on the twelfth season of RuPaul's Drag Race and ultimately placing fourth in the competition.


== Early life ==
Rose was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to a Canadian father and an Iranian mother. He attended UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television to study theatre and upon graduating with his Bachelor of Arts degree, he moved to New York with the goal of doing theatre professionally.


== Career ==
In 2002, Rose transferred to University High School in Irvine where he starred in productions of Dark of the Moon, Les Misérables and Bat Boy the musical. In 2003 he was crowned Prom King as an openly gay student. In 2009, Rose discovered drag. He played the title role in a production of Hedwig and the Angry Inch at Theatre Out at the Empire Theater, in Santa Ana, CA which was his first foray into drag. His first performance as Jackie Cox was at a competition called So You Think You Can Drag at New World Stages in New York. His drag name originated from a nickname that he and a friend, in high school, assigned to a girl that they disliked but wanted to be able to talk about her in public. As her initials were ""J.C."", they came up with ""Jackie Cox"" as a codename.
Jackie was announced as a cast member on season 12 of RuPaul's Drag Race on January 23, 2020. She is the second Canadian contestant on the US version of the show, and the oldest performer on Season 12. Jackie became the first contestant in Drag Race history to dress in a Muslim-inspired outfit on episode 9 of the show, which had a ""stars and stripes"" patriotic theme. She wore a red-striped kaftan with a blue hijab outlined with 50 silver stars. Guest judge Jeff Goldblum subsequently came under fire for his comments over Jackies's hijab outfit, when asking, ""Is there something in this religion that is anti-homosexuality and anti-woman? Does that complicate the issue?"" for which he has been widely criticized. On the same episode, even though Jackie was praised for her choices, she found herself in the bottom two for the first time in the season and had to lip sync against competitor Widow Von'Du to Katy Perry's ""Firework"". Jackie was successful and Von'Du was eliminated.
Jackie Cox appeared on the soap opera Days of Our Lives on April 20, 2022. Chad helped Jackie to crash the wedding of Leo Stark to Dr. Craig Wesley, and announced that Leo was already married to her. He also appeared out of drag, as himself, Darius Rose. Leo claimed that he and Darius were only married to help Darius get a green card. Darius then stunned the wedding party by telling them that Leo and Craig's relationship has been ""one big flim-flam,"" based on the money and prestige Leo believed the marriage would bring by marrying a doctor.
